	* efficient copy cons for List

	* change String::pos

		s[s.pos('%')] == '%'

	would be nice

	* use template handle in handle.hh for strings.

	* Restricted cursor/list: make sublist from a list, and use rcursor as if list is as big as the sublist.

	* move towards gnu?

		parsestream.h
		vector.h
