This ouverture "Imellem Fjeldene" ("Between the Mountains") by 
Niels W. Gade (1788-1854) is typeset from handwritten parts 
available at Statens Musikbibliotek, Stockholm, Sweden. 
No score was available.

A few obvious misprints and inconsistencies between the parts 
have been corrected. This is indicated with comments in the
different source files.

The piece was performed in Ludvika and Östervåla, Sweden, 
March 13-14, 1999, by Bergslagens Kammarsymfoniker conducted 
by Ola Karlsson.

Christian Mondrup has provided the following background on the
piece: 
It was composed 1850 as a ouverture for the comedy "Imellem 
Fjeldene" by the danish poet Carsten Hauch. In the Andante 
introduction, Gade uses a melody from the collection ``Norske 
Folkesagn og Melodier'' (``Norwegian folksongs and melodies'') 
by the danish composer A.P. Bergreen. The song has a norwegian 
text ``Heimreise fraa Sæteren'' by Edvard Storm. The second 
theme of the Allegro part might very well come from the same
collection, namely the song ``Saag du nokke Kjærringa mi''.

The music was typeset using Lilypond, the GNU Project music
typesetter. 

The score and parts may be freely copied.
