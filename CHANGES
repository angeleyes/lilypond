main-time-moment may remain the same during several steps.
  - Change column creation logic in score-engraver.

TODO: look at other filledbox'es (stafflines and barlines don't match up).

* Testing code off by default.  On: -e "(define ps-testing 1)" -fps

* Output via TeX/dvips still gives problems.  Use direct postscript
output for real testing.

 - Fixes for draw_box and draw_beam PostScript routines.
 - Stems reach to top (or bottom) of beam.
 - Beam uses correct stem thickness (only right beams, left TODO).
 - testing code in effect: only outlines are drawn.
