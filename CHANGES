LilyPond (read: ly2dvi) should now work right out of the box.

Amazing; it seems that ly2dvi won't generate PK files without this
dvips wrapper.  We had over 200 downloads of setup.exe, yet only one
`call for help'.  Did all the others give up, or did none of them
bother to share their fix/file a bug report?  Urg.

./configure; make install in buildscripts/ (Michael Vanier).

contrary to what the webpage claims (didn't know that).
