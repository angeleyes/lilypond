1.5.3.hwn1
==========

* midi2ly bugfixes: don't print ';' in .ly output.

* small cleanup of input/bugs/

* bugfix: nested grace notes; added input/regression/grace-nest.ly

* Bugfix: add double alterations to keyAccidentalOrder (Mats)

* Fixes for PostScript beams and stems.

1.5.2.hwn1
==========

* Starting pagenumber (Mark Hindley)

* Ancient font patch (Juergen Reuter) [WARNING: FONT UPDATE!]

* Bugfix: don't  put grace beams on non grace notes, and vice versa.

* etf2ly:
  - miserable try at importing repeatbars and volta brackets;
  - import articulation defs (IX tag)
  - revamped file reading logic. Now much cleaner.

* Experimental regular-spacing support: try to space regular runs of
notes equidistantly.

1.5.2.jcn2
==========

* Flex is fixed in Debian/unstable.  Update documentation accordingly.

* Guile 1.3.4 compile fix.

* Add trill line type, see input/test/trill.ly.

* Dvips bugs workarounds:
  - Draw filledbox in tex for now.  Test ps code using

     lilypond -e '(define ps-testing 1)'

  - Extend stems only half way into beam.

* Change order of includes in tex/lilyponddefs.tex so that feta font
can be used a little easier, like:

    title="TeX \fetachar\fetasharp"

* Update stepmake/bin config.sub, config.guess.

1.5.2
=====

1.5.1.hwn1
==========

* small bugfixes for grace-init.ly

* Bugfix: don't mess up spacing when combining different tuplets.

* Small bugfixes for lilypond-mode.el.

* property-init.ly: bugfix for dot directions in polyphonic music.

1.5.1.jcn3
==========

* Bugfix: text2html: escape entities inside <pre>.

* Added some template .ly's for evaluation.

* Make blot work without -fps too.

* Use blot diameter for postscript beams and boxes.

* Guile-1.5.0-cvs updates and Guile-1.4.x compatibility.

* Beam knee fix.

* Now really included lexer-gcc-3.0.patch.

* Make Voice context accept Thread again; this fixes MIDI output for music
that uses Thread contexts.

* Removed debug printing from chord-name.scm.

1.5.0
=====
1.5.0.jcn1
==========

* Added feature to ly2dvi to find feta pfa font files used in a
postscript file to make printing of direct postscript a bit easier:

    lilypond -fps input/trip.ly
    cat $(ly2dvi -f trip.ps) trip.ps | lpr

* Reincluded 1.4.3.jcn2.

* Website fixes.

* Ly2dvi now leaves .tex and .latex output if latex fails, and cleans
the temp dir if anything fails.

* Fixes for windows scripts.

1.5.0.uu1
=========

* Hara kiri and span-bar.

* Junk old grace stuff.

* Don't crash on grace notes in MIDI output.



1.5.0
=====

* experimental grace notes:
  - add grace timing to Moment
  - hack to Sequential_music_iterator to use the correct timing for
the note before a grace
  - change the implementation of \grace construct
  - property set/unset (eg. font size) is done through startGraceMusic
and stopGraceMusic
  - various engraver fixes to deal with the fact that the
main-time-moment may remain the same during several steps.
  - Change column creation logic in score-engraver. 

* Bugfix: don't crash when \name not set in \translator block.

* rename ly/*.ly to ly/*-init.ly (except language files) to avoid
name clashes

* deprecate Property_engraver, add Font_size_engraver to Staff, Voice
and Thread.

* Change mailing list address: *gnu-music*@gnu.org becomes
*lilypond*@gnu.org

* Put span-bar lines only between the other barlines, not on top of
them (thanks to Juergen Reuter)

1.4.4.jcn3
==========
  
TODO: look at other filledbox'es (stafflines and barlines don't match up).

* Testing code off by default.  On: -e "(define ps-testing 1)" -fps

* Output via TeX/dvips still gives problems.  Use direct postscript
output for real testing.

* Beam and stem fixes:
 - Stems drawn in PostScript (should do all filledbox'es in PS?).
 - Fixes for draw_box and draw_beam PostScript routines.
 - Stems reach to top (or bottom) of beam.
 - Beam uses correct stem thickness (only right beams, left TODO).
 - testing code in effect: only outlines are drawn.
