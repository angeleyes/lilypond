1.3.38.hwn2
===========

* General cleanups of My_lily_parser. 

* Start of a Chord_tremolo_iterator for the `\repeat 4 "tremolo"'
syntax.

* Moved Score_element::do_space_processing out of the dependency
mechanism.

* Use Scheme for notename tables.  Removed uppercase letters for low
octave notes. Removed Notename_table.

* Fixed core dump with declared "\key  ; "

* Extra robustness warning for Side_position_interface::aligned_on_self ()

* Extra robustness: make sure that first and last columns are breakable.
  	
1.3.38.jcn4
===========

* stepmake/aclocal.m4: Added support for cross-compiling with guile.

* buildscripts/make-cygwin-cross.sh: A try at dropping cygwin1.dll
 dependency by using mingw.  Compiling guile is too much to ask
 for mingw, though.  Also:
 - rename python scripts .py (request from Alain)
 - install native packages under their own, separate root. (Alain)

* lily.scm: Don't use regex module when running on
Windows. (Shamus)

* lily/staff-margin-engraver.cc (acknowledge_element): If
possible, hang y-axis of margin script to span-bar.  This fixes
vertical placement of margin scripts attached to staff groups.

* help2man-rules.make: Fixes for generating manpages by copying
and for building using --scrdir.

* stepmake/stepmake/generic-targets.make: Preserve date stamp of
config.h, version.hh files file when copying.

* buildscripts/make-cygwin-cross.sh: made number of fixes:
	- add `Cygnus/' prefix to directories in .zip-file too.
	- package guile too.
	- don't link to cygwin1.dll

* stepmake/stepmake/install-targets.make: bugfix, don't fail if directory
  is not emty when uninstalling.
	
* stepmake/stepmake/generic-targets.make: added man target.

* buildscripts/make-cygwin-cross.sh: new script for cross-building cygwin
  development tools and lilypond executable.

* Documentation/ntweb/lilypond-manpages.patch: provide pre-built
  manpages, so that make doesn't fail on help2man trying to execute
  a GNU/windows executable.	

* Documentation/ntweb/guile-1.3.4-gnu-windows.patch: new patch for
  guile-1.3.4.  

* flower/libc-extension.cc (memmem): cygwin compile fix.

1.3.38
======

1.3.37.hwn1
===========

* (generic-property.scm) added \property tieDash to set dashing on
ties.

* Removed  ly_eval_str(), we should use scm_eval (Scm_object).

* Removed scm_to_array (), array_to_scm (), associated junk. Reverted
undocumented .29 patch that made Bezier::control_ into an
Array<Offset>.  Added some comments documenting the reasons for the
changes.

* Revert generic-property.scm of .37 fix, fix the real problem in
property-engraver.cc: use the right symbol to check if element
property is already set.

1.3.37.jcn2
===========

* Fixed srcdir build, so that you can do:

      tar xzf releases/lilypond-x.y.z
      mkdir <build>
      cd <build>
      ../lilypond-x.y.z/configure
      make

  as with any other gnu package.  All build output goes to <build>/out.

* Changed and fixed use of different configurations, and different output
  directories.  Finally, you can use different configurations alongside
  eachother.  From make/stepmake.make:

      # Use alternate configurations alongside eachother:
      #
      #     ./configure --enable-configsuffix=debug
      #     make conf=debug
      #
      # uses config-debug.make and config-debug.h; output goes to out-debug.
      #

      # Use same configuration, but different output directory:
      #
      #     make out=WWW
      #
      # uses config.make and config.h; output goes to out-WWW.
      #


* Fixed performance of (de)crescendi.

* Better documentation for arithmetic_multiplier and arithmetic_basicspace
  in params.ly.

* Added instrument-equaliser for MIDI output, see scm/midi.scm, and
  properties midiMinimumVolume, midiMaximumVolume, ranges [0,1].

* Changed absolute midi volume settings into factor of full scale.

* Fixed another dynamic-line-spanner bug, it gets hairy.

* Added warning for spanners that are not fully contained in parent spanner.


1.3.37
======
1.3.36.hwn1
===========

* Abstract Align_element into Align_interface. Removed
Axis_align_{item,spanner}, Align_element, Super_element, all multiple
inheritance in the backend.

* new Gade score, INSTALL.texi fixes (thanks, Mats)

* Removed Item::hpos_f (), Score_element::{get,set}_real ()

* comments detailing properties for Axis_group_interface,
Side_position_interface, Score_element, Item and Spanner

1.3.36.jcn3
===========

* Fixed vertical dimensions of elements in dynamic line spanner by adding
  axis-group to dynamic line spanner.

* Bugfix: line-spanner lasts always full duration of (de)crescendi.

* Bugfix: broken (de)crescendi on a dynamic-line-spanner.

* Bugfix: compilation dynamic-engraver.

* Added and updated a faq about postscript and ghostscript.

* Fixed order of slurVerticalDirection verticalDirection in
  generic-property.scm.  Similar fixes for Stem, Tie, etc.

* Added a Text_engraver to GraceContext.  Maybe it was removed on
  purpose: scripst on grace notes seem broken, they appear on the
  main note.

* Bugfix: volume effect of (de)crescendi was sometimes wrong way round.

1.3.36
======
1.3.35.hwn1
===========

* textEmptyDimension changed into textNonEmpty, default: off,
ie. texts don't occupy space.

* Use STL map for Lookup::lookup_p_tab_p_

* Abstracted Axis_group_element into Axis_group_interface, and removed
Axis_group_element. This eliminates some multiple inheritance in the
backend

1.3.35.jcn1
===========

* Added minimum-space property to Side_position_interface.  Used in
  positioning of Volta_spanner: voltaMinimumSpace.

* Fixed and cleaned-up volta-spanner.

* Moved directional-element.cc -> directional-element-interface.cc

* Renamed all `process_requests' to `process_music', which fixes
  midi performance.

* Fixed dimensions (more x-y interchanges) of brace, bracket and
  volta-spanner.

* Bit half-baken fix in to get similar vertical placement of orphaned vs.
  line-spanned dynamic elements.

* Added property bracketCollapseHeight: the minimal size of a staff bracket
  that will be typeset.  Smaller brackets will not be displayed.  This
  fixes the (in 1.3.x reintroduced) funny duck-beak-bracket-bug (sorry).

* Removed some dissonant chords from Coriolan

1.3.35
======

* Removed Documentation/programmer directory 

1.3.34.jcn3
===========

* Small enhancements to Staff_margin_engraver:
   - by default, the marginScript left aligns the text
   - to set the text style, use property marginScriptTextStyle
   - to change the alignment, use property marginScriptHorizontalAlignment
     (centred and right alignment require manual padding settings).

* Print a friendly message if the manual pages failed to build.

* Bugfix: dynamicDirection now overrides verticalDirection setting.

* Warning messages and nl.po

* Fixed vertical alignment for all dynamic items and (reluctantly)
  reinstated old directional behaviour for orphaned dynamics.

* Finished maximumRestCount property.

1.3.34
======
1.3.33.hwn2
===========

* Print key without setting key, syntax "\key ;". General cleanups of
key-item.

* Add paragraph tags in HTML output of mudela-book.  Music fragment
don't run into the text anymore.

* Bugfix: don't align the first line of text. (Lookup::text ()).

* Abstract away data members of Axis_group_element, Align_element


1.3.33.jcn3
===========

* Added helpful properties instrumentScriptPadding/instrScriptPadding for
  Staff_margin_engraver.

* Removed some empty files, substituted (c) 1999 occurrences.

* Added \property maximumRestCount.  It will prevent showing (or actually:
  moving in case of a collision) more than maximumRestCount similar rests.
  WIP!

* Rewrote Staff_margin_engraver.  Staff margin texts now hang on a new
  breakable item: Left_edge_item.

* Fixed vertical alignment for dynamic elements.  Orphaned dynamic items
  (not supported by a Dynamic_line_spanner) still collide with Staff,
  although they now have staff support, which was supposed to fix this.

* Fixed Staff_margin_engraver for "instrument", "instr" is still broken.

* Dynamic elements are only put in a Dynamic_line_spanner if there
  actually is more than one adjacent note-column with a dynamic.
  This breaks the fine looks of all dynamics, again :-)




1.3.33
======

1.3.32.hwn3
===========

* Experiment: use STL map for Scheme_hash_table; Is there a speedup?

* Bugfix: print brace iso. bracket for Piano / GrandStaff

* Change naming: change do_post_processsing into after_line_breaking,
do_pre_processsing into before_line_breaking and do_process_requests
into do_process_music.

* Bugfix in hash-table.hh: do quadratic probing, and not cubic probing.

* Display property name for type error.

* Cleanups for Dynamic_engraver and Dynamic_line_spanner.

* Warn if last column in score is musical. Helps catch programming errors.

* Spanner::spanned_drul_ now is private. 

* Rewrote some bar code: moved molecule functions out of Lookup.

1.3.32.jcn3
===========

* Embedded newlines in text items are now allowed.  This helps avoiding
  TeX-hacking in some cases.  See input/test/coriolan-margin.ly

* Fixed stupid x-y interchange bug for staff-bracket.  This fixes
  placement of staff-brackets.

* Fixed bracket/arch-thickness interchange bug, and made bracket a bit
  thinner.

* Fixed slur/bezier-beautiful name mismatch.  This should fix the steep
  slurs that were apparently reintroduced in 1.3.29.

* Made some small fixes to Coriolan.

* Removed duplicate lily/output-property-engraver.hh.

* Removed optional use of vanilla spanner in Dynamic_engraver.

* Fixed (measured) tremolo for Stem and Beam. Merged declarations
  stem-engraver.hh and chord-tremolo-engraver.hh into their .cc
  implementation file.  Also fixed looks of Chord tremolo, input and
  implementation is still ugly.

* Added *.yy and *.ll to TAGS, to that tags-find-replace doesn't omit
  parser and lexer.

1.3.31.mb1
=========

* Fixed \specialkey and \normalkey. Updated documentation.

1.3.32
======
1.3.31.jcn5
===========

* Fixed and cleaned-up Dynamic_engraver.  Optionionally uses vanilla
  spanner instead of Dynamic_line_spanner.

* Made gcc-2.95 compile fix in libc-extension.

* Various fixes to Coriolan, score starts to look acceptable.

* Moved optional text of crescendo into Crescendo spanner.  Fixed horizontal
  and vertical alignment of dynamics.

* Added new text crescendo spanners to Coriolan and made some fixes.
  If you're using timidity, use the -EO option to prevent notes get
  stuck.  I'm not sure whose fault this is, Lily's MIDI output may be
  stretching the standard a bit.

* Adjacent dynamic markings are now grouped on a horizontal line, but it's
  not perfect yet: they're always below the staff and no horizontal spacing
  is done.  Also, character metrics of dynamics are still not used.
  See: input/test/crescendi.ly and input/test/dyn-line.ly

* Cleaned up Span_dynamic_performer.

1.3.31
======
1.3.30.mb1
=========

* Fixed the page layout, reintroducing space for the header and
  trying to keep piece titles on the same page as the piece.
  The header and footer can now contain several lines.

1.3.30.jcn3
===========

* Lily now also performs crescendi and decrescendi in MIDI output:
  Span_dynamic_performer (bit scrappy).

* Added preliminary support for crescendi/decrescendi other than `hairpins',
  eg: `cresc. poco `a poco -- -- --'

* Made MIDI tie performance fix.

1.3.30.jcn2
===========

* Lily now performs absolute dynamics in MIDI output.

* Included David's comments on opus47 in TODO.

1.3.30.jcn1
===========

* More Coriolan: flute-1,2; oboe-1,2; clarinet-1,2; 
  fixes and remainder french horn-1,2; trombone-1,2;
  fagotto-1,2; timpani; and several fixes.
  
1.3.30.uu1
==========

* Remove some old doco from programmer/ and put on personal homepage.

* Removed union-find from flower library.

* Only quantise tie horizontal part inside the staff.

1.3.30
======
1.3.29.hwn1
===========

* Report type errors for \property. Helps with converting 1.2 input

* Use Scheme for Align_element; fixed graceAlignPosition 
and removed \property alignmentReference in the process.

* Use generic properties for lyrics too.  This fixes \property
Lyrics.textStyle


* Add relative distance for constraints between non-column items.

* Automatic \marks: use "\mark ; ". The mark numbers or letters are
increased automatically.

* Translators now only change properties of their own context. This
removes the 2nd argument to Translator::get_property()

* Bugfix for Metapost mode

1.3.29.uu1
==========

* Updates of glossary  (Christian Mondrup)

* Bugfix with bar number placement

* Moved links to bibliography/ and misc/ to main index.

1.3.29
======

* Moved Slur-specific code from Bezier_bow to Slur and Slur_bezier_bow.
  Slurs are now calculated just once.

* Bezier_bow gets constants from paper.  Still no sensible solution for
  magic asymmetry gradient step constants.

* Reinstantiated tangent-controls, more flexible than ever.  You can choose
  between area asymmetry and tangent-controls.  My guess is, tangent controls
  will be junked in 1.3.30.

* Slur area: only look at x-gradient.

* Added credits for some symbols of as5/9 fonts.

* Bugfix: don't make almost flat slurs, change in de-uglyfy slur.  

* Bugfix: midi2ly put out recent version (ugh).

1.3.28.hwn2
===========

* Bugfix: don't forget to process staffSpace and numberOfStaffLines
properties.

* Removed Gade score. To appear (shortly?) on Mutopia. 

* Make Bar_script_engraver look for typeVisibilityFunction (eg
property barNumberVisibilityFunction). Changed the names of the Scheme
functions to be understandable. See input/test/bar-script-visibility.ly

* rewrite of class Molecule. It has now reached the ultimate quality
plateau. All molecule data is now shared.

1.3.28
======

* Update of the glossary by Christian Mondrup 

* Moved horn-concerto-3 out of tarball to private website, removed
W.A.Mozart subdirectory.

1.3.27.hwn1
===========

* Bugfix: don't make giant ties if the horizontal part of tie is near
the center.

* Small optimizations to be a little more careful with mem usage. 

* Website change: put all examples in one directory.

* Removed Atom as a separate type.  Now use SCM, and since we use
function composition, Atoms are immutable, so they don't have to be
copied. This makes life easier, hopefully this is quicker and uses
less memory.

1.3.27.jcn1
===========

* Bezier_bow: minimise_enclosed_area

1.3.27
======

1.3.26.hwn4
===========

* Tuplet-spanner slope calculation now looks better on tupletted rests
(patch courtesy Laurent Martelli)

* Bugfix (Staff_performer::new_instrument_str ()) check type of
\property "instrument"

* New mechanism for breaking lines: do not copy & prune the element
property list separately, but combine these steps. Dramatically
reduces memory usage for large scores.

1.3.27
======
1.3.26.jcn2
===========

* Bugfix: font used in volta-spanner calculation.

* Added simple selection list to webpage, inspired by sawmill.
 
* Devised kludge for ascii 5 character font pitches.
 
* Substitutions: interline, 1997,1998, @stack.nl and small typo fixes.

1.3.26.hwn1
===========

* Plug memory leaks related to Moment:
  - Spacing_engraver::do_pre_move_processing ()
  - make_rational ()/make-rational
  - Paper_column::Paper_column ()

* Plug memory leak in Paper_outputter::output_{String,Real,int}_def()

* Plug memory leak in Score_engraver::set_columns ()

* Plug memory leak in Scheme_hash_table::set()

* Plug memory leak in Score_element::molecule_extent ()

* Bugfix: don't crash if a slur doesn't span anything.

* Bugfix: don't crash if doing beams without a staff symbol.

* Generic element property setting:

	\outputproperty #predicate #'symbol = #value

Will set the element property symbol to value, for any elements that
return true for PREDICATE.  This allows you to virtually tweak *ANY*
property of the output. Example in input/test/generic-output-property.ly

1.3.26
======

* lilypond as as2ly: --help and --version to stdout.  Regular identify 
  to stderr.  This fixes help2man's manpage generation.

* configure: substitute full path for perl and guile in scripts.

* Added ascii slur and volta.  There seems to be a Lily bug in volta placement.

* Bugfix: default font now user settable

* as2text: handle plain ascii font, read from stdin, you can now do:

  echo "\time 4/4; g''1 g2 g4. g8" | lilypond -f as -i init-as.fly - | as2text

1.3.25.hwn1
===========

* Bugfix: second half of broken ties now are displayed again.

* Bugfix: add clef to the support of 8 text in the G_8 clefs. Center
it horizontally on the clef.

* Added Tie_column spanner. Ties in tied chords now get proper directionsa.

* Bugfix: unbroken repeat barlines now work, eg. |:

* Added Request_iterator to make more flexible constructions possible.

1.3.25
======
* as2text: catch missing font/character errors, added default font, set text.

* New ascii fonts and glyphs: as5 as-numeral4 as-braces9

* Ascii output, minimal support:
  - AsciiScript Fonts: mf/*.af
  - Init files: ly/*-as.*ly 
  - AsciiScript translation to text: scripts/as2text.scm
  - input/test/as.fly input/test/as1.fly
  - Output support: lily/lily.scm
  - Try:
      lilypond -f as -i init-as.fly input/test/as.fly
      as2text as.as

1.3.24.hwn1
===========

* The horizontal part of ties will avoid collision with staff lines.

* Plugged memory leak: don't protect Atom function.

* Lookup cleanups. Made lots of functions static. Moved some code out
of Lookup.



1.3.24.hwn1
===========

* Bugfix: ly2dvi.py exits succesfully when encountering --help and
does not delete any of the file_ly*.tex.

* Added header and footer support in ly2dvi.py

1.3.24
======

* Added a ROADMAP file explaining the source directory layout.

* Minor tweak in the feta 6 and 9 numeral
 
* Moved files from lib/ to flower/

* Removed Note_head_side class.

* Updated the webpage to be a little more chatty. 

* Small Local_key_engraver optimization: only lookup timing engraver once.

* Fixed dashed slurs

* Rewrite of Slur code.  Be much more picky about slur shapes. We try
to offset the slur instead of bending it too much

* Look at stem directions for tie direction.

* Compound multimeasure rests. Put measures_i_ variable in an element
property.  Made the symbol a lot wider.

* Time signature small cleanups.

1.3.22.hwn2
===========

* Symbols opposite to stem (eg marcato) now get the proper glyph in up
version.

* Breathing marks now have a direction by default.

* Do set generic script properties.

* Also put tuplet brackets under notes.

* Score_element_info: only store origin of element, but not the path
to parent translators. Saves a little memory, and removes some complexity.


1.3.22.hwn1
===========

* Autobeaming in time sigs that don't have 1/4 beats fixed.

* (De)crescendi should now work. (Thanks Michael)

* Better error reporting for conflicting time signatures.

* Line_number_engraver: output locations of note head
definitions. Very handy when entering complicated scores.

* Rewrote multi measure rest support: now they are entered as spanners
(\commandspanrequest \start "rest"). RXXXX is an abbreviation for

  { \commandspanrequest \start "rest"
    SXXXX
    \commandspanrequest \stop "rest"
  }

* Removed support of percent style repetitions. 

* Put texts outside the staff.

1.3.21.mb1
==========
* Getopt bugfix: don't assert on certain errors.

* ly2dvi: Remove unnecessary space for the page headers.

* Bugfix convert-mudela

1.3.21.hwn1
===========

* Bugfix in lilypond-mode.el: eval-buffering now uses file name and
not buffer name.

* Scrapped tupletVisibility property. Now use tupletNumberVisibility,
tupletBracketVisibility, with Scheme value #t, #f or 'if-no-beam.
\property tupletInvisible will stop all tuplet spanner creation.

* Don't go berserk if tuplet spanner is on only one column.

* Use SCMs & Smobs for Molecules & atoms.  This uses less
scm_(un)protect_object () calls, so the output stage should be faster.

* Added \property tupletSpannerDuration, to make multiple tuplet signs
with one \times.

* Some programming Errors in spacing are now caught. Lily does not
hang when encountering degenerate springs.

* Allow beams to start and end over rests

1.3.19.hwn2
===========
* Fix disappearing clefs when clefs are not printed with a barline.

1.3.20.jcn2
==========

* SCM properties beamHeight and beamVerticalposition now use half-spaces:
  input/test/beam-control.fly
* Added \context Voice to .fly and .sly; the default \context Staff is almost
  never what you expect
* Fixed decision for .sly/.fly in lilypond-mode.

1.3.19.hwn1
==========

* Clean up font-metric hierarchy, use Adobe AFM code to parse AFM files.
Cleanup mf-to-table.py

* Fixed embarassing slur bug.

==========

* lilypond-mode.el for emacs supersedes mudela-mode.el 

* Tuplet spanners don't collide with encompassing notes. 

* Gobbled Adobe parseAFM* code, for future use.

* Big 1999 to 2000 search/replace.

* Big interline to staff_space search/replace for mf files.

(even more scm2int/int2scm mixups!)

* mutopia/J.S.Bach/pa.ly: organ score (for my father)

* small fix to mutopia/J.S.Bach/Duette/violino-ii.ly

1.3.17.hwn2
===========

* Remove Paper_def calls in bezier-bow.cc

* Remove data members of Tuplet_spanner,  Volta_spanner

* hang_on_clef, property hangOnClef removed

* Bar::type_str_ mode into element property `glyph'. Use a Scheme
function to determine breaking behavior.

* More Scheme typechecking.

* Be strict about the difference between strings and symbols for conversion.

* Fixed bug that made 1st line offset to right fixed. Bugfix courtesy
Laurent Martelli.

* Partial French translation, courtesy Laurent Martelli.

* Small corrections in NL translation. 

1.3.17.hwn1
===========

* Added mensural note heads (noteHeadStyle = "mensural") Additionally,
we have a longa note head.  noteHeadStyle = "harmonic" is not
supported anymore. (for now, that is)  

* Reference manual update. Document \properties with examples

* fix mudela-book --help

* Use element properties for Text_item::text_str_, Clef_item::symbol_,
Key_item::c0_position_

* Clef_engraver general cleanup. Use alists (\property
supportedClefTypes, clefPitches) for clef types.

* Use progress_indication () for progress. Don't include <iostream.h> directly 
Don't include <string.h>, <math.h> from headers.


1.3.16.hwn1
===========

* \property stemCentered (boolean): centers stem on note head. See
input/test/stem-centered.ly

* input/trip.ly, small test of lots of features.

* \property Staff.collisionMergeDotted: merge equal noteheads
with different dot count. See input/test/collision-merge-dotted.fly

* Volta repeats fixed.

* cleanup of Note_heads_engraver

* removed dots_i_ member of Dots

1.3.16.jcn1
===========
* Fixed cross staff slurs.  It seems that cross-staff sign
  was swapped.

1.3.15.hwn1
===========

* Fixed bug in stem code.  Stem in chords works again.  Small
stem cleanups.

* Use element properties for Staff_symbol.

* \property sparseTies (boolean).  Only make one tie in the
middle for tied chords.

* Junked Directional_spanner, Column_info.
Directional_element now is element interface `Directional_element_interface'

* cleanup: use to_boolean () iso. gh_boolean_p && gh_bool2scm
