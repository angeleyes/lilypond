1.5.22

a lot faster.

sucky.

1.5.21
======
1.5.20.jcn1
===========

* Fixed direct PostScript output, and changed default fonts.

* Bugfix: automaticMelismata in refman (huh, or should lily be changed?)

* pktrace:

      cp mf/out/feta20.* $HOME/usr/src/sketch-0.7.8/Resources/Fontmetrics
      echo 'TeX-feta20,feta20,Roman,-gnu-feta20-medium-r-normal,adobe-fontspec\ific,feta20' >> $HOME/usr/src/sketch-0.7.8/Resources/Fontmetrics/std.sfd

1.5.20
======

1.5.19.jcn3
===========

* Sketch output:

  - Sketch uses feta font.
  - Fix to linewidth and feta fontsize.
   - mf-to-table: write dummy values in afm to make sketch happy.
  - Fixes to glyphs: rectangles beziers work now.
   - Bugfix: sketch.scm: use primitive-eval.

* Sketch and feta Type1 fonts:
   - textrace:
      wget http://www.inf.bme.hu/~pts/textrace-latest.tar.gz
      tar xzf textrace-latest.tar.gz
      (cd autotrace-0.27ap; ./configure; make)
      ./traceall.sh feta20 feta20.pfb $HOME/usr/src/lilypond/mf/out

  - copy mf/out/feta20.* to sketch/Resources/Fontmetrics:

   - append to sketch/Resources/Fontmetrics/std.sfd:
      echo 'TeX-feta20,feta20,Roman,-gnu-feta20-medium-r-normal,adobe-fontspecific,feta20' >> $HOME/usr/src/sketch/sketch/Resources/Fontmetrics/std.sfd

   - Hmm, then find that

     + Sketch accesses characters by name, ie, the
      name characters have in default text fonts.  Luckily, textrace
      mangles the feta names too.  Sadly, textrace chooses different names
      for characters > 128.

    + Textrace mangles font name by prepending `TeX-'.  Doesn't seem to
      pose a big problem; we'll have to pefix `TeX-' to feta fonts.

    + Sadly, only the sketch-0.7.x is happy with the feta type1 font, but
      printing is not yet implemented?

 * Remove modules directory (again?).
