1.5.0
=====

* experimental grace notes:
  - add grace timing to Moment
  - hack to Sequential_music_iterator to use the correct timing for
the note before a grace
  - change the implementation of \grace construct
  - property set/unset (eg. font size) is done through startGraceMusic
and stopGraceMusic
  - various engraver fixes to deal with the fact that the
main-time-moment may remain the same during several steps.
  - Change column creation logic in score-engraver. 

* Bugfix: don't crash when \name not set in \translator block.

* rename ly/*.ly to ly/*-init.ly (except language files) to avoid
name clashes

* deprecate Property_engraver, add Font_size_engraver to Staff, Voice
and Thread.

* Change mailing list address: *gnu-music*@gnu.org becomes
*lilypond*@gnu.org

* Put span-bar lines only between the other barlines, not on top of
them (thanks to Juergen Reuter)

1.4.4.jcn3
==========
  
TODO: look at other filledbox'es (stafflines and barlines don't match up).

* Testing code off by default.  On: -e "(define ps-testing 1)" -fps

* Output via TeX/dvips still gives problems.  Use direct postscript
output for real testing.

* Beam and stem fixes:
 - Stems drawn in PostScript (should do all filledbox'es in PS?).
 - Fixes for draw_box and draw_beam PostScript routines.
 - Stems reach to top (or bottom) of beam.
 - Beam uses correct stem thickness (only right beams, left TODO).
 - testing code in effect: only outlines are drawn.
