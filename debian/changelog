lilypond (1.1.37-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Known problem: LilyPond simply segfaults under glibc 2.1 on my i386
    system, and I don't know how to fix the problem yet.  I hope users of
    other platforms have better luck.
  * [debian/rules]:
      - Make and install info files.
      - Removed "CC=egcc" because the default gcc on all platforms is
        now the one from egcs.
      - Install *.png instead of *.xpm.
      - Minor clean-ups.
  * Added debian/compress to make sure *.png are not compressed.

    from lilypond_1.0.xx series.  I forgot these changes when I moved
    from 1.0.19.uu3-1 to 1.1.29-1.  Sorry!  :-)
  * [make/lilypond-vars.make]: Copied the definition of TEX_TFMDIR from
      make/toplevel.make.in and added it to LILYINCLUDE...
  * Applied the patch lilypond-1.1.31.jcn1.diff from Jan Nieuwenhuizen.
  * [debian/rules]:
      - Temporarily use "-$(MAKE) -k -C Documentation/tex dvi" to
        circumvent the occasional \times segfault problem when building
        refman.dvi.
      - Added symlink /usr/lib/texmf/fonts/tfm/public/lilypond.

      Thanks to Roland Rosenfeld <roland@spinnaker.rhein.de>
      for the bug report. (closes: Bug#30123).
  * [debian/control]: Now also Recommends: tetex-extra (>= 0.9.981030-1)
      because the .dvi documentation uses the EC fonts in that package.

      Thanks to Julian Gilbey <jdg@maths.qmw.ac.uk> for the bug report
      (closes: Bug#29407).
  * [scripts/ly2dvi.py]: Re-added a patch similar to the one in 1.0.17-1,
      but teTeX's default search path is now placed *before* the ones that
      ly2dvi adds.  Thanks to Roland Rosenfeld <roland@spinnaker.rhein.de>
      for the bug report. (closes: Bug#29459).

 -- Anthony Fok <foka@debian.org>  Mon, 23 Nov 1998 21:29:25 -0700

lilypond (1.0.18-1) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream bug-fix release.
  * [debian/control]:
      - Upgraded to standards version 2.5.0.0 (no changes).
      - Recommends: python-misc (>= 1.5.1) because ly2dvi needs the glob
        module in the python-misc package (closes: Bug#29283).
      - Updated dependencies on tetex* to the latest versions:
          Depends: tetex-bin (>= 0.9.981031-2)
          Recommends: tetex-base (>= 0.9.981030-1)
        due to changes in tetex's directory structure.
  * [debian/rules]:
      - The symlink ../../../../../share/lilypond/mf is now named
        /usr/lib/texmf/fonts/source/public/lilypond instead of
        /usr/lib/texmf/fonts/source/public/mf (Bug#29284).
      - In the latest tetex-base package, /usr/lib/texmf/doc is now a
        symlink to /usr/doc/texmf.  Therefore, we now install lilypond's
        documentation into /usr/doc/texmf/musixtex/lilypond.
        (closes: Bug#28999, Bug#29326)
  * [debian/preinst]:
      - The script now removes the directories
        /var/spool/texmf/pk/*/public/mf and /var/spool/texmf/tfm/public/mf
        created inadvertently by Debian's buggy lilypond 1.0.17-1.  :-)
        (Bug#29284)
      - Since 1.0.17-1, /usr/lib/texmf/tex/lilypond has been changed to a
        symbolic directory.  The script now removes the old real directory
        to prevent problems during upgrade (closes: Bug#29284).
  * [debian/postinst]: I copied a few lines from tetex-nonfree's postinst
      to remove the old directory /usr/lib/texmf/doc if lilypond is the
      last package to use that directory, and create a symlink to
      /usr/doc/texmf.  :-)
  * Rebuilt with yodl (1.31.7-1) installed to ensure the documentations
    are compiled properly (closes: Bug#29285).
  * Thanks to Fabien Ninoles <fab@tzone.org>, Roland Rosenfeld
    <roland@spinnaker.rhein.de> and Julian Gilbey <jdg@maths.qmw.ac.uk>
    for reporting the bugs listed above. :-)

  * [debian/{copyright,control}]: pcnov095.win.tue.nl -> ftp.cs.uu.nl
      (New upstream master FTP site).  Also updated JCN's web site URL.
  * [debian/rules]: 
      - Now, in the "clean:" target, runs either 
        "find . -user root | xargs -r chown $$SUDO_USER.$$SUDO_GID" or
        "find . -user root | xargs -r chown $$LOGNAME" to deal with all those
        root-owned "out/*" files generated during a "sudo debian/rules clean"
        run.  Thanks to Roman Hodek <Roman.Hodek@informatik.uni-erlangen.de>
        for reporting the problem!  (closes: Bug#27044)
      - Updated debian/rules according to the new debhelper rules example.
      - Now configures with --disable-optimise instead of --enable-optimise,
        otherwise it would not compile.
      - Added symlinks to directories under /usr/lib/texmf because lilypond
        now puts everything under /usr/share/lilypond.
  * [Documentation/topdocs/AUTHORS.yo]: Added a trailing "/" on URLs. 
  * [scripts/ly2dvi.py]: Added a hack to add an extra os.pathsep (":" on
      Linux) to TEXINPUTS and MFINPUTS, otherwise ly2dvi and TeX would fail
      to find the necessary files.
  * Compiled with libstdc++2.9.  :-)

lilypond (1.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * [aclocal.m4]: Temporarily changed OPTIMIZE="-O2" to OPTIMIZE="-O"
      to avoid egcs (c++) complaint of "Internal compiler error"
      on my computer.
  * [scripts/mudela-book.py]: Added "#!@PYTHON@" at the top.  This string
      expands to "#!/usr/bin/python" in /usr/bin/mudela-book.
      (Thanks to Lintian.  :-)
  * [debian/control]: Recommends: python-base (>= 1.5.1).
      (Again, thanks to Lintian.  :-)
  * [debian/postrm]: Now also removes the generated LilyPond fonts
      *.{tfm,pk} under /var/spool/texmf when called as "postrm remove".
  * [debian/preinst]: Yes, have to bring this back to remove the generated
      LilyPond fonts in /var/spool/texmf because "postrm remove" didn't do
      its jobs in previous versions.  Oops.  :-)
  * [debian/rules]: Installs a few new upstream documentation files, and
      the example files in out/ directories are moved to parent directories.

lilypond (0.1.60-1) frozen unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release with lots of bug fixes, including the MIDI
    generation bug in 0.1.48.  Please put this in Hamm.
  * debian/control:
     - Upgraded to standards version 2.4.1.0 (no changes).
  * debian/rules:
     - lilypond now also depends on tetex-base (>= 0.9-5)
       and conflicts with tetex-base (<< 0.9).
  * Modified postinst and postrm to work with teTeX 0.9 / Web2C 7.2:
     - Removed all the *ugly* kludges and functions that were supposed to
       deal with non-Debian teTeX installations.  Those kludges were
       specifically made for teTeX 0.4, but they failed to work as intended
       due to the changes in teTeX 0.9.
     - No longer messes with special.map because the standard
       Web2C 7.2 special.map already lists the feta fonts.
     - Since postinst is so much simpler, it is now a sh script!  :-)
  * Removed preinst which contained yet another obsolete kludge to clean
    obsolete/ancient lilypond fonts.
  * Updated the GNU LilyPond Home Page URIs.

  * Temporarily includes *.xpm instead of *.gif files because
    the netpbm package is not installed on va.debian.org, and
    also because it violates Policy 2.1.2.  Thanks to
    James Troup <J.J.Troup@scm.brad.ac.uk> for bug report!  :-)

    add_fonts() subroutine was slightly buggy.
  * Unpatched ./configure.  It turned out that I spelt "--enable-optimise"
    as "--enable-optimize" in debian/rules by mistake.  Oops!  :)  Thanks
    to the upstream author for pointing this out!  :)
  * The upstream authors has included the ./debian/* files in the pristine
    source archive!  They also fixed some minor errors in README.debian
    and copyright.  Thanks a lot!  :)
  * Removed the line "dh_clean" from "binary-arch:" and switched the order
    of dh_clean in "clean:" in debian/rules.  dh_clean was deleting
    the zero-byte file ./make/out/Site.make, causing the build to fail.

lilypond (0.1.29-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * Patched ./configure in source package to make c++ use the -O2 -g options
    on all the files.  Now, /usr/bin/lilypond is a lot leaner!  <smile>
    (I will discuss it with the upstream author.)
  * Adapted postinst (a Perl script) from the musixtex package for lilypond.
    Now postinst adds the new LilyPond font entries into
    /usr/lib/texmf/fontname/special.map.
  * Added preinst to clean up my mess from previous releases: the old
    "stray" automatically generated TFM and PK font files were placed in
    the wrong directories because they were not listed in
    /usr/lib/texmf/fontname/special.map.
  * Did some minor clean-up in debian/rules and switched to debhelper.
  * Updated Standards-Version to 2.3.0.1
