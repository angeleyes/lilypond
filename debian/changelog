lilypond (0.1.60-1) frozen unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release with lots of bug fixes, including the MIDI
    generation bug in 0.1.48.  Please put this in Hamm.
  * debian/rules:
     - Upgraded to standards version 2.4.1.0 (no changes).
     - lilypond now also depends on tetex-base (>= 0.9-5)
       and conflicts with tetex-base (<< 0.9).
  * Modified postinst and postrm to work with teTeX 0.9 / Web2C 7.2:
     - Removed all the *ugly* kludges and functions that were supposed to
       deal with non-Debian teTeX installations.  Those kludges were
       specifically made for teTeX 0.4, but they failed to work as intended
       due to the changes in teTeX 0.9.
     - No longer messes with special.map because the standard
       Web2C 7.2 special.map already lists the feta fonts.
     - Since postinst is so much simpler, it is now a sh script!  :-)
  * Removed preinst which contained yet another obsolete kludge to clean
    obsolete/ancient lilypond fonts.
  * Updated the GNU LilyPond Home Page URIs.

lilypond (0.1.45-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream "The Utrecht Release".
  * Compiled on va.debian.org because egcs 1.0.1 on my computer
    no longer comes with libg++.  :-(  But hey, va.debian.org
    sure is fast!  <grin>
  * Temporarily includes *.xpm instead of *.gif files because
    the netpbm package is not installed on va.debian.org, and
    also because it violates Policy 2.1.2.  Thanks to
    James Troup <J.J.Troup@scm.brad.ac.uk> for bug report!  :-)
    (Fixes Bug#18212)
  * debian/rules: Added "dh_undocumented ly2dvi.1".

lilypond (0.1.32-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * Applied a small fix to postinst.  The font-entries-search-and-replace
    add_fonts() subroutine was slightly buggy.
  * Unpatched ./configure.  It turned out that I spelt "--enable-optimise"
    as "--enable-optimize" in debian/rules by mistake.  Oops!  :)  Thanks
    to the upstream author for pointing this out!  :)
  * The upstream authors has included the ./debian/* files in the pristine
    source archive!  They also fixed some minor errors in README.debian
    and copyright.  Thanks a lot!  :)
  * Removed the line "dh_clean" from "binary-arch:" and switched the order
    of dh_clean in "clean:" in debian/rules.  dh_clean was deleting
    the zero-byte file ./make/out/Site.make, causing the build to fail.

lilypond (0.1.29-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * Patched ./configure in source package to make c++ use the -O2 -g options
    on all the files.  Now, /usr/bin/lilypond is a lot leaner!  <smile>
    (I will discuss it with the upstream author.)
  * Adapted postinst (a Perl script) from the musixtex package for lilypond.
    Now postinst adds the new LilyPond font entries into
    /usr/lib/texmf/fontname/special.map.
  * Added preinst to clean up my mess from previous releases: the old
    "stray" automatically generated TFM and PK font files were placed in
    the wrong directories because they were not listed in
    /usr/lib/texmf/fontname/special.map.
  * Did some minor clean-up in debian/rules and switched to debhelper.
  * Updated Standards-Version to 2.3.0.1
