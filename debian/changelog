lilypond (2.2.6-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream stable release.  (Closes: Bug#264263)
  * urgency=high to ensure entrance into Debian Sarge.
  * Special thanks to Daniel Burrows for the previous NMUs!  :-)
    (Closes: #257335, #261861)
  * Added patch by Werner Lemberg to lilypond.py so that Asian scripts
    may be used with LilyPond.  Need to "apt-get install latex-ucs"!  See
    http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/lilypond-devel/2004-07/msg00071.html
  * Thanks to Ferenc Wagner for letting me know of some packaging bugs
    that I have introduced over the years:
     - Removed obsolete MAKE_PFA_FILES=1 from "make" invocations.
     - s/--enable-optimise/--enable-optimising/;
     - Removed Build-Depends: autotrace; mftrace prefers potrace.
  * Let's follow Han-wen's Red Hat SPECS file too: --disable-checking.

lilypond (2.2.3-1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * The doc-base file was coming from upstream!  Kill it dead in
    debian/rules clean so that it doesn't keep coming back from
    the grave to haunt me. (Closes: #261861)

lilypond (2.2.3-1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload
  * Removed doc-base files for the lilypond and lilypond-data packages;
    moved the description of the info files to the doc-base file of the
    lilypond-doc package, which actually contains them; corrected the
    location of the info files in the doc-base file. (Closes: #257335)

lilypond (2.2.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.  (Closes: Bug#242861)
    - Thanks to Pedro Kroeger for providing interim sid packages while
      I was away for an extended period of time.
  * Copied some ideas from Ferenc Wagner's LilyPond for woody (Thanks!):
     - Split out shared data to lilypond-data package.  (Closes: Bug#233406)
     - Make lilypond-data conflict with earlier lilypond versions.
     - debian/control: Relaxed autotrace Build-Depends (>= 0.29).

lilypond (2.1.0-2) unstable; urgency=low
 
  * A few HTML links in Documentation/user/{introduction,tutorial}.itely
    went up one too few level in the directory tree, i.e. broken links.
    Thanks to D. Raleigh Arnold for the bug report.  (Closes: Bug#208208)
  * Build-Depends: imagemagick; lilypond uses "convert" nowadays.
    Thanks to Daniel Schepler for the bug report.  (Closes: Bug#221062)

 -- Anthony Fok <foka@debian.org>  Wed, 19 Nov 2003 10:12:16 +0800

lilypond (2.1.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

    Thanks to Petter Reinholdtsen for the bug report, and thanks to
     Peter Hawkins for adopting the PfaEdit package!  (Closes: Bug#217216)
  * Build process used to redirect to /dev/stderr which does not exist in
    all environments.  Upstream replaced it with ">&2" in 1.9.0 in August.
    Thanks to Daniel Schepler for the bug report.  (Closes: #215481)
  * Added symlink from /usr/share/lilypond/$(VERSION)/fonts/type1 to
    /usr/share/texmf/fonts/type1/public/lilypond.  Thanks to Pedro Kroger
    and Mats Bengtsson's discussion on the lilypond-devel:

lilypond (1.7.29-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release, preparing for lilypond-1.8.  :-)
  * stepmake/bin/add-html-footer.py: Use LOGNAME only if it exists.
    pbuilder unsets LOGNAME and Python returns KeyError.
    Thanks to Daniel Schepler for the report.  (Closes: Bug#193065)
  * debian/rules: Revert to calling ./configure rather than ./autogen.sh.
  * An issue with autoconf <= 2.57 and g++ >= 3.3 has been preventing
    getopt-long.cc from compiling.  A workaround was checked in by upstream
    author Jan Nieuwenhuizen on 2003-06-08, and the fix in aclocal.m4 was
    backported from 1.7.29.  (Closes: Bug#197761)
  * Mark Brown says 1.7.27 has fixed FTBFS on m86k too.  Thanks for the
    note!  (Closes: Bug#200510)
  * Run dh_scrollkeeper to register *.omf files.

 -- Anthony Fok <foka@debian.org>  Fri,  1 Aug 2003 05:40:04 +0800

lilypond (1.6.9-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * CVS updates as of 2003-04-29.  (Thanks, Jan!)
  * "Empty midi2ly.1" problem has been fixed upstream.  (Closes: Bug#181927)
  * Build-Depends: autoconf2.13 and run autogen.sh in debian/rules
    to ensure this package passes the auto-build daemons.  :-)

 -- Anthony Fok <foka@debian.org>  Thu,  1 May 2003 13:18:57 +0800

lilypond (1.6.9-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release with CVS updates as of 2003-04-15.
    Jan Nieuwenhuizen has backported fixes to deal with build problems
    with flex (>= 2.5.29).
  * Rebuild with guile-1.6 packages.
  * Merged debian/* fixes by upstream author Jan Nieuwenhuizen (Thanks!):
    - Depend on mftrace (>= 1.0.17-1) instead of pktrace.
    - Add guile-1.6-dev as alternative dependency to libguile-dev
    - Bugfix for docdir when with changed package name.
    - Remove bibtex2html dependencies.  (LilyPond has come with its own
      bib2html for some time now.  However, xpmtoppm and pnmtopng from
      netpbm is still needed - foka)
    - Remove gcc-3.x/lexer kludge.
  * midi2ly.1 was empty because help2man calls midi2ly but it couldn't
    "import midi": python/out/midi.so wasn't built until later.  Added
    a kludge in debian/rules to regenerate midi2ly.1 manually.
    Thanks to Colin Watson for reporting the bug.  (See Bug#181927)

lilypond (1.6.6-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Hmm, so /usr/share/texmf/dvips/config is an symlink, and thus
    /usr/share/lilypond/1.6.6/dvips/lilypond.map conflicts with tetex-base.
    Let's move it to /etc/texmf/dvips/lilypond.map then, and make it a
    conffile.  Thanks for all the (duplicate) bug reports!  ;-)

lilypond (1.6.6-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
  * Updated Debian section in Documentation/topdocs/INSTALL.texi.

 -- Anthony Fok <foka@debian.org>  Tue, 22 Oct 2002 02:05:33 +0800

  * New upstream release.
  * binary-arch: Changed "DH_OPTIONS=-a" to "DH_OPTIONS=-s" so that

    fix.  (Closes: Bug#157766)

    Jones and his hppa build daemon for the report. (Closes: Bug#153402)

    Thanks to Russell Neches for the report.  (Closes: Bug#152228)

  * As per Jan's suggestion, now Build-Depends: pktrace (>= 1.0.3-1),
    pfaedit (>= 0.0.20020312-1), autotrace, t1utils

lilypond (1.4.12-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream maintenance release.
  * Several important fixes (including our bison-related patch added
    to 1.4.10-1) are included since 1.4.11 this release.  (Now, I
    don't even need to increase teTeX's extra_mem_top, extra_mem_bot
    or pool_size!  :-)  Please include in Woody.
  * Fixed a typo in lilypond-doc package description: typestting ->
    typesetting.  Thanks, Matt Zimmerman!  (Closes: Bug#125083)

 -- Anthony Fok <foka@debian.org>  Sun, 24 Feb 2002 02:06:15 +0800

lilypond (1.4.10-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release.
  * lilypond failed to build with bison >= 1.30 because bison's output file
    has been renamed.  Applied an upstream fix.  (Closes: Bug#133692)
  * lilypond's documentation also failed to build with the latest
    tetex or texinfo package.  Instead of increasing extra_mem_top and
    extra_mem_bot, increasing pool_size does the trick.

 -- Anthony Fok <foka@debian.org>  Mon, 18 Feb 2002 11:41:31 +0800

lilypond (1.4.9-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release.
  * Oops, libc6-dev is known as libc6.1-dev and libc-dev on some
    architectures.  Fixed Build-Depends so that lilypond can be built
    on all platforms.  Thanks to Colin Watson for reporting the bug.
    (Closes: Bug#120208)

 -- Anthony Fok <foka@debian.org>  Tue, 27 Nov 2001 23:28:11 +0800

lilypond (1.4.8-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * [debian/rules]: Use -s instead of -a so that lilypond would get built
     on all architectures even when the dummy lilypond1.3 package isn't
     built.  Thanks to Ryan Murray for the report.  (Closes: Bug#117622)
  * Depends on python instead of python-base.  The python scripts in
    lilypond work with old and new Python versions.
  * Build-Depends on "-z combreloc"-enabled binutils (>= 2.11.92.0.10-2)
    and libc6-dev (>= 2.2.4-5) so that lily runs faster!  :-)

lilypond (1.4.8-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release.  (Closes: Bug#111132)
  * Stopped using $(PWD) in make, as it doesn't seems to work on
    potato systems with older "make".  Reverted to `pwd`.
    Thanks to Wolfgang Schnitker for notifying me this problem.
  * Changed the lilypond1.3 dummy package's Architecture from "all"
    to "arm i386 m68k powerpc sparc".  Also, as upstream updated
    config.sub and config.guess to recognize ia64 and hppa.
    Thanks to Anthony Towns for the bug report.  (Closes: Bug#114266)
  * Versioned Build-Depends: flex (>= 2.5.4a-14) to ensure gcc-3.0
    compatibility.

 -- Anthony Fok <foka@debian.org>  Sun, 14 Oct 2001 18:28:45 +0800

lilypond (1.4.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Upstream includes lexer-gcc-3.0.patch which should fix compilation

    Updated Build-Depends.

lilypond (1.4.3-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release.
  * Urgency high because LilyPond-1.2.17 is too buggy and yet it has
    been stuck in testing forever.  LilyPond-1.4.x fixes multiple
    serious bugs.  :-)
  * Ah, silly me, lilypond was conflicting against itself!  I forgot
    to remove this relics during the switch from lilypond1.3 to lilypond.
  * Fixed a new bug in lily/main.cc which caused lilypond to skip over every
    other command-line argument.
  * [configure.in]: Added -mieee to CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS when building on
     Alpha to prevent FP exception.  Thanks to Christopher C. Chimelis
     for the fix!

 -- Anthony Fok <foka@debian.org>  Fri, 15 Jun 2001 00:42:46 -0600

lilypond (1.4.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Moved "bibtex2html, gs | gs-aladdin, netpbm (>= 2:9.10-1)"
    from Build-Depends to Build-Depends-Indep because these packages
    are only needed for building lilypond-doc.

 -- Anthony Fok <foka@debian.org>  Tue, 29 May 2001 02:26:58 -0600

lilypond (1.4.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.  (Closes: Bug#97598)
  * export extra_mem_top=100000 and extra_mem_bot=100000, otherwise
    latex runs out of memory when processing standchen.dvi.latex.
  * Split the documentation into the "lilypond-doc" package, which
    provides the LilyPond website in /usr/share/doc/lilypond/html.

lilypond (1.3.150-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Renamed package from lilypond1.3 back to lilypond.
    This also fixes a lot of bugs from the old lilypond-1.2.17 package.
    lilypond1.3 is temporarily provided as a dummy transitional package.
    Closes: Bug#67697, 84352, 48731, 72223, 85834.
  * [debian/rules]:
     - No longer blindly copy intermediate DVI files into
       the deb package.  Thanks to Daniel Burrows for the reminder.
       Closes: Bug#87852.
     - Added "export MODE=ljfour" and "export BDPI=600" because I use
       something different in my local /etc/texmf/mktex.cnf and that
       broke the build.
  * Fixed Build-Depends because pnmtopng has been merged into the netpbm
    package.  Thanks to Adrian Bunk for the notice.  Closes: Bug#93961.
  * [lily/kpath.cc]: Modified to better conform to web2c fontpath policy.

lilypond1.3 (1.3.132-1) unstable; urgency=medium

    /etc/emacs/site-start.d/50lilypond1.3.el (debian/emacsen-startup)

lilypond1.3 (1.3.129-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * In memory of Werner Icking + (August 26, 1943 - February 8, 2001),
    a dear friend, a kind educator, and a hard worker in sharing beautiful
    typeset music to the world.  (Maintainer of the GMD Music Archive,

  * New upstream release.
  * Upstream has changed from "lilypond-mode" to the "studly caps name"
    "LilyPond-mode".  Fixed /etc/emacs/site-start.d/50lilypond1.3.el
    (debian/emacsen-startup).  Thanks to Christophe Rhodes for the bug
    report.  Closes: Bug#83732.
  * Added "Build-Conflicts: lilypond, lilypond1.3" to prevent old
    lilypond font files from potentially interfering with the build on
    other Debian ports autobuilders.
  * Built with libguile-dev (1:1.4-9) or newer to ensure correct
    linkage to libqthreads.so.9.  Also updated the Build-Depends and
    Depends fields accordingly.  Thanks to guile1.4 package maintainer
    Rob Browning for his notification and to Daniel Burrows for his bug
    report.  Closes: Bug#85896.

    in Documentation/topdocs/INSTALL.texi (hence INSTALL.txt).
  * Applied Han-wen's one-line patch to lily/system-start-delimiter.cc
    to remove bracket-width.
  * It seems that bracket-width needs to be removed from
    scm/grob-description.scm and scm/interface-description.scm too.

  * New upstream development release with numerous bug fixes, small
    enhancements, and updates to documentation.
  * [debian/postinst]: Fixed the pathname to README.Debian.  Thanks to
      Olivier Abad for the bug report (closes: Bug#58674).
  * [debian/rules]: Now configure with --enable-optimise again.
      Yes, it appears that LilyPond and glibc2.1.3 finally get along
      nicely even with optimisation turned on.  Hurray!  :-)
  * [Documentation/user/*]: Fixed some formatting bugs in the texinfo files.
  * [debian/control]: Modified description to hint that 1.3.43 is better
      than 1.2.17.  :-)
  * [debian/{rules,emacsen-startup}]: Added an Emacs startup file
      /etc/emacs/site-start.d/50lilypond1.3.el so that lilypond-mode is
      automatically loaded for *.ly files.

  * [postinst]: Runs "/usr/bin/mktexlsr /usr/share/texmf" to save time.
  * [postrm]: Removed the unnecessary "/usr/bin/mktexlsr" call.

 -- Anthony Fok <foka@debian.org>  Tue, 11 May 1999 11:16:58 -0600

lilypond (1.1.37-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Known problem: LilyPond simply segfaults under glibc 2.1 on my i386
    system, and I don't know how to fix the problem yet.  I hope users of
    other platforms have better luck.
  * [debian/rules]:
      - Make and install info files.
      - Removed "CC=egcc" because the default gcc on all platforms is
        now the one from egcs.
      - Install *.png instead of *.xpm.
      - Minor clean-ups.
  * Added debian/compress to make sure *.png are not compressed.

  * s!usr/lib/texmf!usr/share/texmf!g and cleaned up old hacks
    in {pre,post}{inst,rm} files due to tetex's new FHS-compliant

      tetex-{bin,base,extra} (>= 0.9.99031{0,1}-1) packages.

lilypond (1.1.31-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Re-incorporated the changes in debian/rules and debian/postinst
    from lilypond_1.0.xx series.  I forgot these changes when I moved
    from 1.0.19.uu3-1 to 1.1.29-1.  Sorry!  :-)
  * [make/lilypond-vars.make]: Copied the definition of TEX_TFMDIR from
      make/toplevel.make.in and added it to LILYINCLUDE...
  * Applied the patch lilypond-1.1.31.jcn1.diff from Jan Nieuwenhuizen.
  * [debian/rules]:
      - Temporarily use "-$(MAKE) -k -C Documentation/tex dvi" to
        circumvent the occasional \times segfault problem when building
        refman.dvi.
      - Added symlink /usr/lib/texmf/fonts/tfm/public/lilypond.

 -- Anthony Fok <foka@debian.org>  Thu, 18 Feb 1999 00:25:04 -0700

lilypond (1.1.29-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * [stepmake/aclocal.m4]: AC_STEPMAKE_GUILE now calls the GUILE_FLAGS
      macro to set -lqthreads etc., otherwise Guile would not be detected
      by the configure script.

      Thanks to Roland Rosenfeld <roland@spinnaker.rhein.de>
      for the bug report. (closes: Bug#30123).
  * [debian/control]: Now also Recommends: tetex-extra (>= 0.9.981030-1)
      because the .dvi documentation uses the EC fonts in that package.

 -- Anthony Fok <foka@debian.org>  Thu, 10 Dec 1998 17:43:57 -0700

      Thanks to Julian Gilbey <jdg@maths.qmw.ac.uk> for the bug report
      (closes: Bug#29407).
  * [scripts/ly2dvi.py]: Re-added a patch similar to the one in 1.0.17-1,
      but teTeX's default search path is now placed *before* the ones that
      ly2dvi adds.  Thanks to Roland Rosenfeld <roland@spinnaker.rhein.de>
      for the bug report. (closes: Bug#29459).

 -- Anthony Fok <foka@debian.org>  Mon, 23 Nov 1998 21:29:25 -0700

lilypond (1.0.18-1) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream bug-fix release.
  * [debian/control]:
      - Upgraded to standards version 2.5.0.0 (no changes).
      - Recommends: python-misc (>= 1.5.1) because ly2dvi needs the glob
        module in the python-misc package (closes: Bug#29283).
      - Updated dependencies on tetex* to the latest versions:
          Depends: tetex-bin (>= 0.9.981031-2)
          Recommends: tetex-base (>= 0.9.981030-1)
        due to changes in tetex's directory structure.
  * [debian/rules]:
      - The symlink ../../../../../share/lilypond/mf is now named
        /usr/lib/texmf/fonts/source/public/lilypond instead of
        /usr/lib/texmf/fonts/source/public/mf (Bug#29284).
      - In the latest tetex-base package, /usr/lib/texmf/doc is now a
        symlink to /usr/doc/texmf.  Therefore, we now install lilypond's
        documentation into /usr/doc/texmf/musixtex/lilypond.
        (closes: Bug#28999, Bug#29326)
  * [debian/preinst]:
      - The script now removes the directories
        /var/spool/texmf/pk/*/public/mf and /var/spool/texmf/tfm/public/mf
        created inadvertently by Debian's buggy lilypond 1.0.17-1.  :-)
        (Bug#29284)
      - Since 1.0.17-1, /usr/lib/texmf/tex/lilypond has been changed to a
        symbolic directory.  The script now removes the old real directory
        to prevent problems during upgrade (closes: Bug#29284).
  * [debian/postinst]: I copied a few lines from tetex-nonfree's postinst
      to remove the old directory /usr/lib/texmf/doc if lilypond is the
      last package to use that directory, and create a symlink to
      /usr/doc/texmf.  :-)
  * Rebuilt with yodl (1.31.7-1) installed to ensure the documentations
    are compiled properly (closes: Bug#29285).
  * Thanks to Fabien Ninoles <fab@tzone.org>, Roland Rosenfeld
    <roland@spinnaker.rhein.de> and Julian Gilbey <jdg@maths.qmw.ac.uk>
    for reporting the bugs listed above. :-)

lilypond (1.0.17-1) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream "stable" release.
  * [debian/{copyright,control}]: pcnov095.win.tue.nl -> ftp.cs.uu.nl
      (New upstream master FTP site).  Also updated JCN's web site URL.
  * [debian/rules]: 
      - Now, in the "clean:" target, runs either 
        "find . -user root | xargs -r chown $$SUDO_USER.$$SUDO_GID" or
        "find . -user root | xargs -r chown $$LOGNAME" to deal with all those
        root-owned "out/*" files generated during a "sudo debian/rules clean"
        run.  Thanks to Roman Hodek <Roman.Hodek@informatik.uni-erlangen.de>
        for reporting the problem!  (closes: Bug#27044)
      - Updated debian/rules according to the new debhelper rules example.
      - Now configures with --disable-optimise instead of --enable-optimise,
        otherwise it would not compile.
      - Added symlinks to directories under /usr/lib/texmf because lilypond
        now puts everything under /usr/share/lilypond.
  * [Documentation/topdocs/AUTHORS.yo]: Added a trailing "/" on URLs. 
  * [scripts/ly2dvi.py]: Added a hack to add an extra os.pathsep (":" on
      Linux) to TEXINPUTS and MFINPUTS, otherwise ly2dvi and TeX would fail
      to find the necessary files.
  * Compiled with libstdc++2.9.  :-)

lilypond (1.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * [aclocal.m4]: Temporarily changed OPTIMIZE="-O2" to OPTIMIZE="-O"
      to avoid egcs (c++) complaint of "Internal compiler error"
      on my computer.
  * [scripts/mudela-book.py]: Added "#!@PYTHON@" at the top.  This string
      expands to "#!/usr/bin/python" in /usr/bin/mudela-book.
      (Thanks to Lintian.  :-)
  * [debian/control]: Recommends: python-base (>= 1.5.1).
      (Again, thanks to Lintian.  :-)
  * [debian/postrm]: Now also removes the generated LilyPond fonts
      *.{tfm,pk} under /var/spool/texmf when called as "postrm remove".
  * [debian/preinst]: Yes, have to bring this back to remove the generated
      LilyPond fonts in /var/spool/texmf because "postrm remove" didn't do
      its jobs in previous versions.  Oops.  :-)
  * [debian/rules]: Installs a few new upstream documentation files, and
      the example files in out/ directories are moved to parent directories.

lilypond (0.1.60-1) frozen unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release with lots of bug fixes, including the MIDI
    generation bug in 0.1.48.  Please put this in Hamm.
  * debian/control:
     - Upgraded to standards version 2.4.1.0 (no changes).
  * debian/rules:
     - lilypond now also depends on tetex-base (>= 0.9-5)
       and conflicts with tetex-base (<< 0.9).
  * Modified postinst and postrm to work with teTeX 0.9 / Web2C 7.2:
     - Removed all the *ugly* kludges and functions that were supposed to
       deal with non-Debian teTeX installations.  Those kludges were
       specifically made for teTeX 0.4, but they failed to work as intended
       due to the changes in teTeX 0.9.
     - No longer messes with special.map because the standard
       Web2C 7.2 special.map already lists the feta fonts.
     - Since postinst is so much simpler, it is now a sh script!  :-)
  * Removed preinst which contained yet another obsolete kludge to clean
    obsolete/ancient lilypond fonts.
  * Updated the GNU LilyPond Home Page URIs.

  * Compiled on va.debian.org because egcs 1.0.1 on my computer
    no longer comes with libg++.  :-(  But hey, va.debian.org
    sure is fast!  <grin>
  * Temporarily includes *.xpm instead of *.gif files because
    the netpbm package is not installed on va.debian.org, and
    also because it violates Policy 2.1.2.  Thanks to
    James Troup <J.J.Troup@scm.brad.ac.uk> for bug report!  :-)

  * New upstream release
  * Applied a small fix to postinst.  The font-entries-search-and-replace

    as "--enable-optimize" in debian/rules by mistake.  Oops!  :)  Thanks
    to the upstream author for pointing this out!  :)
  * The upstream authors has included the ./debian/* files in the pristine
    source archive!  They also fixed some minor errors in README.debian
    and copyright.  Thanks a lot!  :)
  * Removed the line "dh_clean" from "binary-arch:" and switched the order
    of dh_clean in "clean:" in debian/rules.  dh_clean was deleting
    the zero-byte file ./make/out/Site.make, causing the build to fail.

  * Adapted postinst (a Perl script) from the musixtex package for lilypond.
    Now postinst adds the new LilyPond font entries into
    /usr/lib/texmf/fontname/special.map.
  * Added preinst to clean up my mess from previous releases: the old
    "stray" automatically generated TFM and PK font files were placed in
    the wrong directories because they were not listed in
    /usr/lib/texmf/fontname/special.map.
