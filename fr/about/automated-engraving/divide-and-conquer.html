<h2>Plan de campagne</h2>

Since content and form of a score are separate, we have to match that
in the design of software. Hence, the basic blueprint  of our program
should this scheme

<table>
<tr>
<td align="center">
<img src="@IMAGES@simple-notation.png">
</td>
<td align="center">
<b>&larr;</b>
</td>
<td align="center">
<tt>{ c'4 d'8 }</tt>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">
1. form
</td>
<td align="center">
2. translation
</td>
<td align="center">
3. content
</td>
</tr>
</table>

In effect, we are conquering the problem by dividing it into
subproblems

<ol start="1">
<li>Typography:  <b>where</b> to put symbols
<li>Notation:  <b>what</b> symbols to produce
<li>Representation: how to <b>encode</b>  music
</ol>

Finally, whenever you subdivide a problem, a new problem is created,
<ol start="4">
<li> Architecture: glue everything <b>together</b>
</ol>
