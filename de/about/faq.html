<h1>Frequently asked questions</h1>


<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3>What is LilyPond?</h3>
<p>
   LilyPond is an "automated engraving system." It will format music
  notation beautifully without requiring typographical expertise of
  its users.
</p>


<h3>Automatic notation, so that means I can play the music, and then
  it rolls out of the printer?</h3>

<p>
  No.  Our system assumes that the input data is available in an exact,
  abstract form.  Printing music is difficult enough as it is, so we do
  not wish to add another problem.  Translating what a human plays to
  exact form is hard.  Even if you get the correct pitch data from a MIDI
  keyboard (as opposed to a sound recording), one has to get the rhythms
  correct.  For example, how is a computer supposed to distinguish
  between a staccato quarter note and an eighth note?  Moreover, how
  would you print a piece that you cannot play in such a system?
</p>

<h3>There are other program that do notation.  What's so special about
  yours?</h3>

<p>  
  Modern computer printouts do not look nice: they have a bland,
  mechanical look.  By contrast, we try to mimic traditional plate
  engraving in the general impression, layout algorithms, and the font
  design.  Consequently, our output often beats our competitors when
  it comes to good looks.
</p>

<h3>What is wrong with other computer printed scores?</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
  Computer printed scores often lack subtle variations in spacing, which
  results in mechanical appearance.
  <li>To prevent clashes between different
  symbols, they are spaced very widely, which leads to an "airy"
  look.
  <li>  The heaviness of the layout is matched to that airy look: the
  symbols are usually too light, and the lines are too thin.
  <li>The wide
  spacing also causes a piece of music to take up more pages.
  <li>Beams
  often do not cover stafflines entirely, while slurs and ties do touch
  them, leading to distracting clusters of black and wedges of white
  around these places.
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Normally, one notices these details only subconsiously.  The best way
  to become conscious of these differences is to compare a traditionally
  printed and a computer printed edition of the same piece, preferably
  with a magnifying glass.  If you are not sure: traditional engraving
  is photographically reproduced hand-work, and can be recognized by
  slight irregularities in symbol placement, and small blotches due to
  the reproduction process.
</p>

<h3>What is engraving?</h3>
<p>
  Originally, music was printed by stamping and engraving symbols
  mirrored into metal plates.  The plates were inked, and paper was
  pressed to it, yielding a left-to-right printing.  Hence, professional
  music typography is now known as engraving, even when it is done with
  computers today.  People who do this are called engravers or copyists.
</p>

<h3>Why do you care about engraving?</h3>
<p>
  We think that beautiful music deserves to be printed with a beautiful
  layout.
</p>

<h3>Why would I care about engraving?</h3>
<p>
  Good engraving helps to read the music, making it is easier to play
  from.  For example, if the layout reflects the character of a piece,
  then it is easier to interpret.  If it is tightly spaced, it will
  take less pages, reducing the number of page-turns.  If a system (a
  &ldquo;line&rdquo;) has a unique horizontal layout, then it is more
  easily found back after looking away at the conductor.  A part which
  is printed with heavy symbols and thick lines will be easier to read
  from a distance.
</p>

<p>
  <h3>You say your program is special; you must be trying to sell
    it?</h3>

<p>
  No.  We give it away for free.  Go to the <a href="../install">download page</a>.
</p>

<h3>It's free now, but then you will start charging in the future?</h3>

<p>
  No.  Not only do we give it away for free, but we also deliver it with
  full source code, and permission to distribute, modify, sell or
  mutilate it.  In other words, LilyPond is libre software; it is part
  of the GNU project, and distributed under the terms of the
  <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public
    License.</a> 
</p>

<p>
  We think that this is much more important than cost.  It means that
  you have the freedom to fix, modify and extend the program, or you
  can pay someone else to do so.  We will not force you to upgrade
  when your system is abandoned, and you are not lost when we abandon
  the program.
</p>






<h2>About the program</h2>


<h3>How is LilyPond used?</h3>

<p>
  LilyPond is a compiler: the music is encoded in a <tt>.ly</tt> file.
  When LilyPond is run on it the input is transformed into music
  notation, which is written to disk as PostScript or SVG and
  postprocessed to PDF and PNG.
</p>

<h3>What is the input format?</h3>
<p>
  We have designed our own input format, the <tt>.ly</tt> format.  It is
  a language that encodes music using expressions.  These music
  expressions are composed of simpler music expressions, where the
  simplest expressions are notes and rests.  This is analogous to how
  arithmetical expressions can be broken down in simpler expressions,
  where the simplest expressions are numbers, operators.
</p>


<h3>There are lots of good formats, why not use ABC, MusicXML or
  NIFF or DARMS?</h3>

We have the following requirements.  It must
<ul>
  <li>
    use ASCII,
  </li>
  <li>
    be concise enough to type by hand,
  </li>
  <li>
    have a concise formal specification,
  </li>
  <li>
    be expressive enough to support many types of notation and
    printed formats.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  We believe that none of the existing formats address all these
  requirements.  For example, MusicXML cannot be typed by hand, DARMS is
  limited in its application, ABC has no strict formal definition, and
  NIFF is binary.  Nevertheless, this does not restrict you for using
  those formats: there are filters that convert from various formats to
  <tt>.ly</tt>.
</p>

<h3>How do I learn the syntax?</h3>
<p>
  Take a look at the
  <a href="@DOC@stable/Documentation/user/lilypond.html#Tutorial">tutorial</a>.
  It is pretty short, chopped in easily digestible chunks,
  and we've spent a lot of time polishing it.
  If you like to learn by fiddling around, then you can get input
  examples, by clicking the music images in the tutorial.
</p>

<h3>Stop changing the syntax all the time!</h3>
<p>
  We try to make LilyPond as good as possible, and that implies that we
  continually improve the input format.  We change the syntax whenever we
  feel that it will simplify the language as a whole, or ease the
  learning curve.  Keep in mind that the syntax is as great as it is now
  because we also did this in the past.
</p>
<p>
  Most of the language changes can be handled by running the program
  <tt>convert-ly</tt>, which is supplied with LilyPond.  However,
  <tt>convert-ly</tt> can only do its job if it knows what version the
  original file was written for.  Therefore, it is important to add
  <code>version</code> statements to your files like this: <xmp>
    \version "1.3.17" </xmp>
</p>
<p>
  Changes that cannot be handled by simple edits are marked by a bump in
  the major version number: converting 1.8 to 2.0 files will need
  overseeing.
</p>

<h3>How quick is entering music with LilyPond?</h3>

<p>
  There is no single answer to this, as the time spent depends on the
  complexity of the music, and your fluency in LilyPond.  Music with
  complicated constructs (cross-staff beaming, collisions) takes longer
  to enter than simple monophonic music.  Experienced users have
  reported average times of 3.5 pages per hour for typing
  straightforward music monophonic with an editor only.  This time
  includes corrections and minor layout tweaks.
</p>


<h3>I want to use my MIDI keyboard for entry</h3>


Try the following:

<ul>
  <li>
    Hans Lub's
    <a href="http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/gnu-music-discuss/2001-10/msg00018.html"> emacs/MIDI input mode</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Nicholas Sceaux'
    <a href="http://nicolas.sceaux.free.fr/lilypond">Emacs/MIDI input mode</a>

  <li>
    <a href="http://www.volny.cz/smilauer/rumor/rumor.html">RUMOR</a>
    a command line monophonic MIDI/lilypond entry tool.
  </li>

  <li>
    <a href="http://lilycomp.sf.net">LilyComp</a> a graphic entry
    tool, for those that don't read music well.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>I don't want to learn another syntax.  Now what?</h3>
<p>
  There are other options: it is possible to create the music in another
  format.  Supported formats include 
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>
    MIDI</dt><dd> LilyPond includes midi2ly, a program that translates a MIDI
    file to LilyPond.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    ETF</dt><dd> LilyPond includes etf2ly, a convertor for the Finale ETF
    format (<a href="../devel/misc/etfformat.html">about ETF</a>)
  </dd>

  <dt>
    ABC</dt><dd> LilyPond includes abc2ly, a convertor for the popular ABC
    format (<a href="http://www.gre.ac.uk/~c.walshaw/abc/">about ABC</a>).
  </dd>

  <dt>
    MusicXML</dt><dd> LilyPond includes <code>musicxml2ly</code> a
    partial convertor from MusicXML, and Guido Amoruso's <a
    href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/lilypond-user/2005-12/msg00107.html">xml2ly</a>
    will convert MusicXML to LilyPond.  (<a

     href="http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~brenzala/builder.php?content=projects_biabconverter&lang=en">biabconverter</a>
     will convert Band-in-a-box files to LilyPond.

     </dd>

</ul>


<h3>I want to have an Graphical User Interface!</h3>
<p>
  We have no time to also make a graphical user interface.  Luckily,
  other people have filled the gap.  The following programs have
  competent LilyPond export functions and are actively being developed.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="http://noteedit.berlios.de/">
      NoteEdit</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://www.all-day-breakfast.com/rosegarden/">RoseGarden</a>
  </li>
</ul>
There are also different, non-graphical interfaces:

<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://www.volny.cz/smilauer/rumor/rumor.html">RUMOR</a>
    is an interface to generate LilyPond input with a MIDI keyboard.
  </li>
  <li><a
	 href="http://nicolas.sceaux.free.fr/lilypond/lyqi.html">LyQI</a>
    provides a piano-like keyboard interface using the normal keyboard in
    emacs.  It can also use RUMOR.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>I found a bug.</h3>

<p>
  If you have input that results in a crash or erroneous output, then
  that is a bug.  Please help us by sending a good bug-report: an
  input file that will reproduce the problem.  Please make it small,
  so we can easily isolate the problem.  Don't forget to tell which
  version you use, and on which platform you run it.  Send your report
  to <a
  href="http://post.gmane.org/post.php?group=gmane.comp.gnu.lilypond.bugs">bug-lilypond@gnu.org</a>.
</p>

<h3>Could you add this feature for me?</h3>

<p>
  Sure! Read <a href="../sponsor">sponsoring</a> for more about
  getting custom functionality.

  
</p>

<h3>But it is very easy, just extend the syntax like this...</h3>

<p>
  It is a tempting to think that inventing the syntax solves the
  problem.  In practice, less than 10% of the program is involved with
  handling input and the syntax.  Almost always, adding features
  involves a lot more than syntax, and is also much more complicated.
