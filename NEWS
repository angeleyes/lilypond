New features in 1.8 since 1.6
=============================

** There chord entry code has been completely rewritten. It is now
cleaner and more flexible.

** A new syntax has been added for  text entry.

This syntax is more friendly than the old mechanism, and it is
implemented in a more robust and modular way.

** Deeper integration of the input language and Scheme. You can now use
LilyPond identifiers in Scheme, and use Scheme expressions instead of
LilyPond identifiers.

** The internal representation of music has been cleaned up completely
converted to Scheme data structure.  The representation can optionally
be exported as XML.

** A new syntax has been added for chords:

	<< PITCHES >>

In version 2.0, this syntax will be changed to

   < PITCHES >  for chords

and

   \simultaneous { .. } for simultaneous music.

** A new uniform postfix syntax for articulation has been introduced.

A beamed slurred pair of eighth notes can be entered as

	c8-[-( d8-]-) 

In version 2.0, postfix syntax will be the only syntax
available, and the dashes will become optional.

** User code may now be executed during interpreting.

The syntax for this code is 

	\applycontext #SCHEME-FUNCTION


** New algorithms for chord-name formatting have been installed. This
algorithm can be tuned and has an ergonomic syntax for entering
exceptions.

** Texts may now be put on multimeasure rests, eg.

	R1*20^\markup { "GP" }

** Ancient notation now supports ligatures in Gregorian square neumes
notation, roughly following the typographical style of the Liber
hymnarius of Solesmes, published in 1983.  The line breaking and
horizontal spacing algorithms however are still completely messed up
by ligatures.

** Glissandi can now be printed using the zigzag style.

** Clusters may now be printed. The syntax is:

	NOTE-\startCluster

	..
	NOTE-\stopCluster

** For irregular meters, beat grouping marks can be printed. The
syntax for this is

	#(set-time-signature 7 8 '(3 2 2))

** Nested horizontal brackets for music analysis can now be printed.

	NOTE-\startGroup
		..
	NOTE-\stopGroup

** Ottava brackets are now fully supported as a feature.
The syntax is

	#(set-octavation 1)

** Metronome markings are printed when a
\tempo command is processed. 

** Fingerings can be horizontally on chords.

** The appearance of various glyphs has been fine-tuned 

** Different types of percent style repeats may now be nested

** The emacs support has been extended.

** The manual has been completely revised and extended manual.



New features in 1.6 since 1.4
=============================

* Support for figured bass and tablature.

* Completely rewritten beam formatting: provides much better output
now.

* Completely revised and improved music font.

* Completely rewritten MIDI import support.

* Completely rewritten grace note support. Practically speaking this
means that grace notes can be slurred to normal normal notes.

* Improved accidental handling and formatting: styles for producing
cautionaries may vary, and complex collisions between accidentals of a
chord are handled much better.

* Better spacing: both globally and locally. This includes subtle
details like optical stem spacing.

* More support for ancient notation: mensural ligatures, ambitus
(pitch range) of voices, more shapes, etc.

* More support for piano notation: bracket pedals, directed arpeggios,
arpeggio brackets.

* Easier music polyphonic music entry.

* More extensibility, many speedups and bugfixes

* The manual has been thoroughly revised.

* Development is now hosted at http://savannah.gnu.org, and sources
can be downloaded through anonymous CVS.

* Support for windows: LilyPond is part of the cygwin distribution,
which comes with a user-friendly installer.
