New features in 1.7 since 1.6

* INPUT

** Completely rewritten support for chord entry. Cleaner and more flexible.

** Text entry is now done in a separate mode, and is more ergonomic
than the previous Scheme texts.

** Deeper integration of the input language and Scheme. You can now use
LilyPond identifiers in Scheme, and use Scheme expressions instead of
LilyPond identifiers.

** Music types cleaned up and Schemified.  

** New syntax for chords:

	<< PITCHES >>

This is in addition to the < MUSICS > syntax for simultaneous
music. Combined with this: uniform postfix syntax for articulations:

	c8-[-( d8-]-) 

for a beamed slurred pair of eighth notes.

*NOTE* In version 2.0, this syntax will be changed to

    < PITCHES >  for chords

and

   \simultaneous { .. } for simultaneous music.

** User code evaluation during interpreting. Syntax

	\applycontext #SCHEME-FUNCTION

** XML music output.

** Friendly  chord-name exception entry.

* OUTPUT

** Preliminary Sodipodi/SVG output



* NOTATION

** Ancient notation ... ?? ...  (Jurgen?)

** Completely rewritten text formatting support. It is implemented in a
completely modular way.

** Texts on multimeasure rests can be set by the user.

** Zigzagged glissandi

** Cluster support. Syntax:

	NOTE-\startCluster

	..
	NOTE-\stopCluster

** Beat grouping indications. Syntax:

	#(set-time-signature 7 8 '(3 2 2))

	NOTE-\groupOpen
