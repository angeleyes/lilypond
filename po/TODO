ISSUES -- please read this before doing too much real translating...

	* encapsulate locale strings in _( ) or _f ( )
	* fix/standardise messages
	  - it's silly to translate wrong strings
	  - no leading/trailing punctuation in strings: e.g.
	    _ ("foo found") iso _ ("foo found.), _ ("foo found.\n), ...
	  - no leading/trailing whitespace in strings

	  - Think about translation issues.  
	    In a lot of cases,it's better to translate a whole message
	    the english grammar mustn't be imposed on the transator.
	    So, iso
	      _ ("stem at") + moment.str () + _("doen't fit in beam")
	    have
	      _f ("stem at %s doen't fit in beam", moment.str ())
	    ?

	    Otoh:
	      en: can't open: `foo.ly'
	      nl: kan `foo.ly' niet openen     (1)
		  kan niet openen: `foo.ly'*   (2)
		  niet te openen: `foo.ly'*    (3)

	    The first nl message, although gramatically and stylish correct,
	    is not friendly for parsing by humans (even if they speak dutch).
	    I guess we'd prefer something like (2) or (3)...

	  - don't modularise too much; a lot of words cannot be translated
	    without context.
	    it's probably safe to treat most occurences of words like
	      stem, beam, crescendo as separately translatable words.

	* don't! translate/gettextify:
	  - debug strings
	  - output (ps) strings

TODO
	* native speakers (naïeve sprekerds) that make/take care of {it,..}.po
	* concurrently update Documentation/tex/computer.data
	* convince xgettext my name is <janneke@gnu.org> iso 
	  <fred@botervlieg.flower> :-)
	* create user-friendly input format for multiple languages?

SOLVED/HOWTO
	* because i never install LilyPond, i made these links:

	    ln -s $LILYPOND_SOURCEDIR/po/out/nl.mo 
	        /usr/share/locale/nl/LC_MESSAGES/lilypond.mo
	    ln -s $LILYPOND_SOURCEDIR/po/out/it.mo 
	        /usr/share/locale/it/LC_MESSAGES/lilypond.mo

	  then simply type, e.g.

	    LANG=nl lilypond -h

	* (howto?) avoid keep translating for moving target
	  - make po-update
	  - mv po/out/*.po po (manually!)
	  - edit po/*.po
	  - make -C po
	  - make show-po-update LANGUAGE=xx
