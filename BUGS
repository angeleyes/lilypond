[LinuxPPC-R5, egcs-1.1.2-12c]

Serious egcs-1.1.2-12c (stock LinuxPPC R5) bug on ppc:

	*dest++ = *src++;

Bug report filed, fixed in egcs-1.1.2-12f or gcc-2.95-0a.
Although we've currently got a workaround in place, the compiler
is buggy; you should upgrade:

	ftp://dev.linuxppc.org/users/fsirl/R5/RPMS/ppc/ 


[LinuxPPC-R4, egcs-1.0.2]

All compiling with -O2 is suspect, in particular guile-1.3, and
Lily herself will break.


[Linux i386]

A binary RPM of Guile 1.3 has been distributed from the LilyPond ftp
site.  This binary was made in RedHat 5.x, and it will fail if this
RPM is used with RedHat 6.x.


[GUILE 1.3.2]

Guile 1.3.2 is buggy in several respects. Do not use it for LilyPond.


[Sparc64/Solaris 2.6, make-3.77]

GNU make-3.77 is buggy on this platform, upgrade to 3.78.1 or newer.


[Sparc64/Solaris 2.6, ld]

Not yet resolved.


[AIX 4.3 ld]

The following is from the gcc install/SPECIFIC file.

   Some versions of the AIX binder (linker) can fail with a relocation
   overflow severe error when the -bbigtoc option is used to link
   GCC-produced object files into an executable that overflows the TOC.
A
   fix for APAR IX75823 (OVERFLOW DURING LINK WHEN USING GCC AND  
   -BBIGTOC) is available from IBM Customer Support and from its
   [27]service.boulder.ibm.com website as PTF U455193.   

   Binutils does not support AIX 4.3 (at least through release 2.9). GNU
   as and GNU ld will not work properly and one should not configure GCC
   to use those GNU utilities. Use the native AIX tools which do
   interoperate with GCC.

add -Wl,-bbigtoc to USER_LDFLAGS, ie:

    LDFLAGS='-Wl,-bbigtoc' ./configure


[All platforms] 

Some bugs may be captured in input/bugs/*y

[Linux i386, RedHat 5.2 with updates to 6.0]

Compiling with 

	configure --disable-checking --enable-printing --disable-optimise --disable-debugging

results in core dumps, during parsing of init files. Cause unknown.
Solution: use

	--enable-checking and --enable-optimize

[Linux libg++ 2.7]

LilyPond occasionally crashes while parsing the initialisation files.
This is a very obscure bug, and usually entering the commandline
differently "fixes" it.

	lilypond input.ly 

and

	lilypond -I. ./input.ly 

makes a difference

Typical stacktrace:

	SIGSEGV
	__libc_malloc (bytes=16384)
	?? ()
	yyFlexLexer::yy_create_buffer ()
	Includable_lexer::new_input (this=0x8209a00, s={strh_ = {
		:

This behaviour has been observed with machines that have old libg++
versions (LinuxPPC feb '98, RedHat 4.x).
