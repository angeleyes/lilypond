Document Really Ugly Bugs (coredumps, assert fails, etc)

[Solaris]

Stack frame overwrite on Solaris 2.x (this will produce a seg
fault, signal 11).  Stacktrace

	Engraver_group_engraver::Engraver_group_engraver(int)
	Score_engraver::Score_engraver( )
	get_group_engraver_p()

We don't know a fix or workaround, but compiling without optimisation
might help (Without -O2 optimisation, my execs run fine on Solaris;
without -O2, but with purify, it dumps core)


[Linux Intel]

LilyPond occasionally crashes while parsing the initialisation files.
This is a very obscure bug, and usually entering the commandline
differently "fixes" it.

	lilypond input.ly 

and

	lilypond -I. ./input.ly 

makes a difference

Typical stacktrace:

	SIGSEGV
	__libc_malloc (bytes=16384)
	?? ()
	yyFlexLexer::yy_create_buffer ()
	Includable_lexer::new_input (this=0x8209a00, s={strh_ = {
		:


I get bitten by this every once in a while, and I am very interested
in hints what might be wrong.
