[LinuxPPC-R5, egcs-1.1.2-12c]

Serious egcs-1.1.2-12c (stock LinuxPPC R5) bug on ppc:

	*dest++ = *src++;

Bug report filed, fixed in egcs-1.1.2-12f or gcc-2.95-0a.
Although we've currently got a workaround in place, the compiler
is buggy; you should upgrade:

	ftp://dev.linuxppc.org/users/fsirl/R5/RPMS/ppc/ 


[LinuxPPC-R4, egcs-1.0.2]

All compiling with -O2 is suspect, in particular guile-1.3, and
Lily herself will break.


[Linux i386]

A binary RPM of Guile 1.3 has been distributed from the LilyPond ftp
site.  This binary was made in RedHat 5.x, and it will fail if this
RPM is used with RedHat 6.x.

[GUILE 1.3.2]

Guile 1.3.2 is buggy in several respects. Do not use it for LilyPond.

[LinuxPPC, egcs-1.1b]

Lilypond 1.1.35-1.1.51,...:  Wierd errors in guile scm_gc_mark ()


[All platforms] 

Some bugs may be captured in input/bugs/*y

[Linux i386, RedHat 5.2 with updates to 6.0]

Compiling with 

	configure --disable-checking --enable-printing --disable-optimise --disable-debugging

results in core dumps, during parsing of init files. Cause unknown.
Solution: use

	--enable-checking and --enable-optimize

[Linux libg++ 2.7]

LilyPond occasionally crashes while parsing the initialisation files.
This is a very obscure bug, and usually entering the commandline
differently "fixes" it.

	lilypond input.ly 

and

	lilypond -I. ./input.ly 

makes a difference

Typical stacktrace:

	SIGSEGV
	__libc_malloc (bytes=16384)
	?? ()
	yyFlexLexer::yy_create_buffer ()
	Includable_lexer::new_input (this=0x8209a00, s={strh_ = {
		:

This behaviour has been observed with machines that have old libg++
versions (LinuxPPC feb '98, RedHat 4.x).
