Document Really Ugly Bugs (coredumps, assert fails, etc)


[Linux Intel]

LilyPond occasionally crashes while parsing the initialisation files.
This is a very obscure bug, and usually entering the commandline
differently "fixes" it.

	lilypond input.ly 

and

	lilypond -I. ./input.ly 

makes a difference

Typical stacktrace:

	SIGSEGV
	__libc_malloc (bytes=16384)
	?? ()
	yyFlexLexer::yy_create_buffer ()
	Includable_lexer::new_input (this=0x8209a00, s={strh_ = {
		:


I get bitten by this every once in a while, and I am very interested
in hints what might be wrong.  This problem has only been identified
with libc-5.3 and libc-5.4 platforms, so you might try upgrading to
6.0, ie. GNU libc-2.
