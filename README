INTRODUCTION

This is a beta version of LilyPond (a music typesetter). This release is
preliminary, please do not distribute. Please send your helpful comments and
patches to me, 

  hanwen@stack.urc.tue.nl

PREREQUISITES

TeX, the MusixTeX fonts, g++ > v2.7. The "flower" library, which should be
available from the same source you got this from.

COMPILING

You will need GNU C++ v2.7 or better and GNU make.  If you actually
want to use this, you'd better use the "speedy" compilation flags in
the Makefile.

why G++ >= 2.7? LilyPond & flower lib uses builtin bool and typeof.

USING

No, you shouldn't. Really. If you're still not discouraged; this is
what I type in my xterm:

	lilypond maartje.ly
	tex test
	xdvi test&

This is what the output looks like over here.

PROBLEMS

If LilyPond bombs out, then please recompile using -g, and send a gdb
stacktrace of the crash.


HOW DOES IT WORK

Use The Source, Luke. If you don't know C++, you can try editing
.dstreamrc for copious debugging output.
