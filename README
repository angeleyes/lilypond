INTRODUCTION

This is a beta version of LilyPond (a music typesetter). Please send
your helpful comments and patches to me,

	hanwen@stack.nl

LilyPond is updated very frequently, the latest version is always available at:

	ftp://pcnov095.win.tue.nl/pub/lilypond

PREREQUISITES

Compilation:

	- Unix (any decent Linux distrib is fine)
	- GNU C++ v2.7  or better
	- GNU make.
	- flex
	- bison/yacc
	- The "flower" library
	- which should be available from the same source you got this from.

Operation:

	- TeX
	- the MusixTeX fonts

The Makefile uses perl for trivial
operations, and you could tinker with it to use sed or awk.

COMPILING

Do:

	tar zxf flower-1.11.9.tar.gz
	mv flower-1.11.9 flower
	cd flower; make; cd ..
	tar zxf lilypond-1.2.13.tar.gz
	cd lilypond-1.2.13
	make

why G++ >= 2.7? LilyPond & flower lib uses:

	builtin bool
	typeof
	operator <?, operator >?

USING

No, you shouldn't. Really. If you're still not discouraged; this is
what I type in my xterm:

	lilypond maartje.ly
	tex test
	xdvi test&

This is what the output looks like over here.

PROBLEMS

If LilyPond bombs out, then please recompile using -g, and send a gdb
stacktrace of the crash.


HOW DOES IT WORK

* Use The Source, Luke. If you don't know C++, you can try editing
.dstreamrc for copious debugging output. (use -d)

* the subdir Documentation/ contains some more-in-depth matter on LilyPond

* The source is commented in the DOC++ style.
