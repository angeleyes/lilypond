IMPORTANT:

if you have downloaded a

	*.pre*

version, then this is version is *not* meant for producing nice output
(but to keep your patchsets up to date). It might not even compile.

====================

Please refer to the directory Documentation/ for the real doco.

To generate the pretty-printed docs, you have to run configure first,
and then do this:

	make doc

You can also simply read the .pod sources. It is ASCII text. For your
convenience, a copy of the formatted INSTALL instructions are in
the toplevel directory, as INSTALL.text 


======================

NOTE:

LilyPond is a long way from finished and polished. I do appreciate
