IMPORTANT:

if you have downloaded a

	*.pre*

version, then this is version is *not* meant for producing nice output
(but to keep your patchsets up to date). It might not even compile.

====================

Please refer to the directory Documentation/, Documentation/README.*. 

To generate the pretty-printed docs, do this:

	make doc

You can also simply read the .pod source. It is ASCII text.

======================

NOTE:

LilyPond is a long way from finished and polished. I do appreciate
criticism, comments, bugreports, patches, etc. Please send e-mail to
me,

	hanwen@stack.nl

Have fun!
