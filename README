This is the toplevel README to LilyPond


GNU LilyPond which converts music definition files into visual or
audio output: it can typeset formatted sheet music in TeX and 
and (mechanical) perfomances to MIDI files.

1. VERSIONING

if you have downloaded a

	*.pre*

version, then this is version is *not* meant for producing nice output
(but to keep your patchsets up to date). It might not even compile.

2. REQUIREMENTS

For the compilation and running of LilyPond you need some additional
packages. The most unusual one of this are the mf sources to
MusixTeX. Please refer to the installation instructions on how to
obtain and install them.

3. INSTALLATINON

For your convenience, a formatted copy of the INSTALL instructions are
in the toplevel directory, as INSTALL.text

4. DOCUMENTATION

Please refer to the directory Documentation/ for the real doco.

To generate the pretty-printed docs, you have to run configure first,
and then do this:

	make doc

You can also simply read the .pod sources. They are ASCII text. 

5. COMMENTS

LilyPond is a long way from finished and polished. I do appreciate
criticism, comments, bugreports, patches, etc. Please send e-mail to
