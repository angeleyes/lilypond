THE LILYPOND.ORG WEBSITE

SOURCES

The HTML sources live in a GIT repository.  Git 1.4.4.1 or newer is
required, and Git 1.5.x is highly recommended.  To get a fresh version
run

    mkdir web ; cd web ; git init-db
    mkdir .git/remotes

then write the two following lines to a text file named .git/remotes/web

URL: git://git.sv.gnu.org/lilypond.git/
Pull: web:refs/remotes/origin/web

then run

    git fetch web
    git checkout -b web origin/web


GIT BASICS

The commands above don't only bring you the latest version of the
sources, but also the full history of revisions (revisons, also called
commits, are changes made to the sources), stored in the .git
directory.  You can browse this history with

    git log     # only shows the logs (author, committish and commit message)
    git log -p  # also shows diffs
    gitk        # shows history graphically


Whenever you are asked in this README to pull, it means you should
update your local copy of the repository with the changes made by
others on the remote git.sv.gnu.org repository; run

    git pull web

which tells Git to pull using the remote file .git/remotes/web; with
this remote file already created, the 'pull' command above is in fact
equivalent to

    git pull git://git.sv.gnu.org/lilypond.git/ web:origin/web


Let's explain a bit of Git vocabulary.

A commit is a set of changes made to the sources; it also includes the
committish of the parent commit, the name and e-mail of the author
(the person who wrote the changes), the name and e-mail of the
committer (the person who brings these changes into the git
repository), and a commit message.

A committish is the SHA1 checksum of a commit, a number made of 40
hexadecimal digits, which acts as the internal unique identifier for
this commit.  To refer to a particular revision, don't use vague
references like the (approximative) date, simply copy'n'paste the
committish.

A branch is a tree (in the mathematical or computer science sense) of
commits, and the topmost commit of this branch is called a head.

The "git fetch" command above has created a branch called origin/web
in your local Git repository.  As this branch is a copy of the remote
branch web from git.sv.gnu.org LilyPond repository, it is
called a `remote branch', and is meant to track the changes on the
branch from git.sv.gnu.org: it will be updated every time you run 'git
pull' or 'git fetch' with this branch reference as argument, e.g.
by using .git/remotes/web remote file when running 'git fetch web'.

The 'git checkout' command above has created a branch named 'web'.  At
the beginning, this branch is identical to 'origin/web', but it will
differ as soon as you make changes, e.g. adding newly translated
pages.  Whenever you pull, you merge the changes from origin/web and
your web branch since the last pulling.  If you do not have push
(i.e. "write") access on git.sv.gnu.org, your web branch will always
differ from origin/web.  In this case, remember that other people
working like you on the remote web branch of
git://git.sv.gnu.org/lilypond.git/ know nothing about your own web
branch: this means that whenever you use a committish or make a patch,
others expect you to take the lastest commit of origin/web branch as a
reference.

This README tries to explain most of Git commands needed for
translating the web site.  However, you are invited to read further
documentation to make git more familiar to you; for instance, take a
look at http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/, especially GitDocumentation and
GitGlossary; a good alternative to reading the wiki is reading the
first two chapters of Git User's Manual at
http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html


BUILDING THE WEBSITE

To generate the main web site, run

    make update-versions
    make

If 'make update-versions' fail, remove lilypond.versions file if it
exists and try again.  'make update-versions' does not need to be run
before each 'make' invocation, it is only useful to run it when new
LilyPond releases come out.

The scripts/format-page.py script merges the pages in the
site/template.ihtml template and handles @AT-VARIABLE@ substitutions,
and leaves the result in

    ./out/site

To generate the web site for language LANG (available: LANG), run

    make LANG  # for example:  make nl


REQUIREMENTS

Building the web site requires:

    * python
    * make
    * gettext
    * inkscape

If you want to do translations without building the site, only python
and make are required.


AT-VARIABLEs

    @DEPTH@: home url prefix
    @IMAGES@: image url prefix
    @DOC@: doc url prefix

See scripts/format-page.py for full overview.

DISTRIBUTION

* The format-page.py script is GPL

* Verbatim redistribution of the .html files and images is allowed and
  encouraged.


AUTOMATIC LANGUAGE SELECTION

Apache can be configured to append .LANG.html to an url, where LANG is
the user's browser preferred language.

The format-page.py script strips the .HTML from file names, but for
directory urls, that does not work.  This could be fixed by adding
'/index' to directory urls, but easier is to add an .htaccess (used on
lilypond.org):

    #.htaccess
    DirectoryIndex index



TRANSLATION

Get or update (pull) the sources.  See SOURCES section at the top of
README.


* STARTING A NEW LANGUAGE

Type

    make new LANG=<MY-LANGUAGE>

e.g. <MY-LANGUAGE> "nl" is Dutch, "de" German and "fr" French;
generally <MY-LANGUAGE> is the ISO 639 language code.  A table of
language codes is available in GNU Gettext documentation.

This will copy all original files from site/ to <MY-LANGUAGE>/, e.g.

    site/about/index.html -> <MY-LANGUAGE>/about/index.html

so you can start translating the file <MY-LANGUAGE>/about/index.html
by typing over the original English text.  Typing `make new' does not
overwrite any existing files in the <MY-LANGUAGE>/ folder/, it can
also be used to add pages to an existing translation.

See TRANSLATION file for details on what pages to translate first.

Also, add <MY-LANGUAGE> to scripts/languages.py in order to enable the
translation.


* TRANSLATION HINTS

To translate a page, open the HTML source file with a plain text
editor and translate all plain text, leaving markup and URLs intact.
Tracking changes is much easier, that way.

The best choice for non-destructive editing of HTML source is probably
a simple text editor with syntax coloring such as emacs, jEdit or
Gedit.  You may view and check the result in your favorite browser.
Do not use a word processor, that will probably mess with the markup.

If you think the original text should be changed or fixed, share your
suggestion before pushing any changes.  Typos may be fixed right away.

Do not use Mozilla Composer, at least until it is clear how to
let it really preserve markup.

When you have translated a page, add that page to repository

    git add <MY-LANGUAGE>/about/index.html

When you have done this for pages you have translated, see SUBMIT
section for how to submit your work.


* CHECK STATE OF TRANSLATION

First pull, then run

    make LANG=<MY-LANGUAGE> check-translation

This presents a diff of the original pages since the most recent
revision of the translation.  To check a single page, run

    scripts/check-translation.py <MY-LANGUAGE>/index.html


* UPDATE A TRANSLATION

Check state of the translation using the method described above.  For
each file diff shown in check-translation output, open the
corresponding translated file in a text editor and update the
translation according to the diff.  The translation hints above still
apply.

After updating a translation, also update the GIT committish in the
updated translated pages; do

    git-rev-parse origin/web

to see the last committish, and in each translated page you updated,
replace the old Git committish with the new one.

Run

    make LANG=<MY-LANGUAGE> check-translation

again. If it no more shows any diff, the translation is up to date:
you are ready to submit your changes.



SUBMIT

To submit your work, follow these three steps.

* SANITY CHECK

To check the status of your working tree, do

    git status

It lists files which are different from the last git revision.  Note
that there should not be any untracked files other than those
generated by "make" (like LANG/graphics); if there are any, add them
before doing anything else (see git-add command at the end of
"TRANSLATION HINTS").  Files you have modified (most likely
translation updates) are listed under the "Changed but not updated"
section.  If everything looks good, you are ready to commit.

The following commands are optional if you are sure of what you are
doing, but it is good you play with them a little, so they will be
familiar to you the day you need them.

To verify that all you did since the last commit looks sane,
do

    git diff

This gives you the changes which will be committed by a
"git commit -a".  Maybe you found a little typo in the file
bar/baz.html.  Fix it and verify with

    git diff bar/baz.html

that all is fine.  This command is also useful if there are too many
changes and you want to see changes only for bar/baz.html.


* UPDATE YOUR COPY

To commit your changes to your local git repository (which is always
necessary before pulling), the command to use is

    git-commit [-m 'one-line not too long commit message'] -a | FILES

The

    -m 'commit message'

argument is optional; if you want to write a long commit message, it
is better to omit the -m argument so that Git opens a text editor so
you can write a long commit message.  For this purpose, if Vim is not
your favorite editor, append

    export EDITOR=your_favourite_editor

to  ~/.bashrc, and while you are at it, also append

    export GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL=your.address@example.net
    export GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL=$GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL

to set the author address properly (your name should already be
defined in /etc/passwd).

If you edit the commit message within a text editor, keep the lines
beginning with '#' intact, write at top a short line in English
describing your commit, leave one blank line after this first line,
and after this blank line, if you want to explain the commit in
detail, write blurb with any number of lines.  After this, save the
text and close the editor to complete the commit.

Let's explain now the other arguments.  With the -a option, git will
commit all the changes of all files it knows about (i.e. all that were
present in the revision you worked from, plus all files you added),
where changes can also mean that the file was removed.  (Still, the
untracked files, and the ignored files, listed in .gitignore, are not
concerned by the commit.)  If you prefer to commit files separately,
do not use '-a', but give the files you want to commit as arguments.

For example, if you want to commit a German translation update and
there are no other changes in your working tree, do

    git commit -m 'German updates' -a

Another example: if you have corrected typos in site/foo/bar.html,
site/baz.html, de/foo/bar.html and de/baz.html, you may want to commit
changes in site/ first (see why at 'COMMON ISSUES' section, issue #2)
by doing

    git commit site/foo/bar.html site/baz.html

or, if you are sure you want to commit all modified files in site/,

    git commit site/

The commit message could look like (without the quotes)

"""
Nitpicks

site/foo/bar.html: update mail address
site/baz.html: typo.
# git comments (read them and keep them intact)
# ...
"""


With Git 1.5.0 or newer, you can also commit some files separately by
running "git add" on them, regardless of whether they are already
tracked or not, then by runnning "git commit" as usual (without -a).



* BRINGING YOUR CHANGES TO THE WORLD

If you do not have Git write access to git.sv.gnu.org repository (in
which case a "git push" will only say that permission is denied), send
patches to the lilypond-devel list, the Translation meister will take
care of them. You can create patches like this
(please do this after committing locally and after pulling):

    git format-patch origin/web

You will get a number of patch files:

    0001-summary-of-patch1.txt 
    0002-summary-of-patch2.txt 
    0003-summary-of-patch3.txt 
    ...

Send each of them you haven't already sent to lilypond-devel@gnu.org.
If the Translation meister complains your patches don't apply cleanly,
try this alternative command to make a single clean patch (do it after
committing local changes and after pulling)

    git diff origin/web web


COMMON ISSUES

1) 'make LANG=<MY-LANGUAGE> check-translation' shows a diff for
site/foo/bar.html, but <MY-LANGUAGE>/foo/bar.html is already up to
date. What does it mean?

Somebody has updated the translation and forgot (or didn't want) to
update the Git committish in the translated page.  This happens when
the translator has updated the translation but forgot to update the
GIT committish, or when somebody (a developer or a translator for
another language) has made a change in HTML code in both original and
translated pages.  Whatever the cause is, fix the Git committish
number as if you were updating a translation (see 'UPDATE A
TRANSLATION' section), and submit your changes.

Keep in mind that the check-translation system is intended to help
keeping the translation up to date, so you are responsible for the
correctness of the GIT committish in pages you translate.  It is a
good idea to sometimes (read "once a year") check the translation
against full original pages.


2) I want to correct a typo or to in both original and translated
pages. What's the most convenient way to do it, so that
check-translation doesn't falsely complain?

First make the changes in the English pages (i.e. in site/) and commit
them, then update translation for our language as usual, except
that if you have no Git push access, you have to wait that your
changes are committed before updating the committishes in translated
files.

If you also update other translations and have Git push access, update
the committish ONLY IF the concerned translated page was previously up
to date; if unsure, don't update the committish, or even better don't
update translations other than your language.


SUPPORT

If you have any question or problem regarding translation and Git
usage, search the archives of lilypond-devel@gnu.org, e.g. with "git"
as a keyword; if it is not enough, send an email to
lilypond-devel@gnu.org, you will expect a reply from the Translation
meister or one of our Git experts.
