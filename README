IMPORTANT: if you have downloaded a

	*.pre*

version, then this is version is *not* meant for producing nice output
(but to keep your patchsets up to date)

====================
Please refer to the directory Documentation/, Documentation/README.*

To generate the pretty-printed docs, do this:

	make doc

in the top-level dir


======================

NOTE:

LilyPond is a long way from finished and polished. I do appreciate
criticism, comments, bugreports, patches, etc. Please send e-mail to

	hanwen@stack.urc.tue.nl

Have fun!
