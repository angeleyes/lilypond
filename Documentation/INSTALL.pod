=head1 NAME

INSTALL - installing LilyPond

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This page documents installation  and compilation of LilyPond

=head1 IMPORTANT

if you have downloaded a

	*.pre*

version, then this is version is I<not> meant for producing nice
output, but to keep your patchsets up to date.  It might not even compile.

=head1 PREREQUISITES

For compilation you need.

=over 5

=item *
Unix. LilyPond is known to run on Linux, AIX, Digital Unix and
Solaris

If you have the Cygnus WIN32 port of the GNU utils, it will
even work in Lose NT/95, but don't promise to support it.

=item *
GNU C++ v2.7 or better, with libg++ installed.  Version 2.7.2
or better recommended. I almost positive that it will not compile with
AT&T CC.

=item *
Bash. Most scripts will continue to work with a stock sh, but they
might generate (harmless) syntax errors

=item *
GNU make. 

=item *
Flex (2.5.1 or better). 

=item *
Bison.

=back

=head1 RECOMMENDED

=over 5

=item *
Perl.  Some (mostly unimportant scripts) use Perl for trivial
operations. The documentation was created with the perl's Plain Old
Documentation.

=item *
(GNU) find

=head1 CONFIGURING and COMPILING

to install LilyPond, simply type:

	configure
	make install

This will install the following files:

	/usr/local/man/man1/lilypond.1
	/usr/local/bin/lilypond
	/usr/local/bin/mi2mu
	/usr/local/share/lilypond/*
	/usr/lib/texmf/texmf/tex/lilypond/* 

The TeX include directory is detected dynamically, but it can be
adjusted with B<--enable-texprefix>. The above assumes that you are root and 
have the gnu
development tools, and your make is gnu make.  If this is not the
case, you can adjust your environment variables to your taste:

	export CPPFLAGS="-I /home/me/my_include -DWEIRD_FOOBAR" 
	configure

C<CPPFLAGS> are the preprocessor flags. 

the configure script is Cygnus configure, and it will accept
B<--help>. If you are not root, you will probably have to make it with

	configure --prefix=/home/me_myself_and_I/

Since LilyPond currently is beta, You are advised to also use

	--enable-debug
	--enable-checking

other options include:

	--enable-printing
	--enable-optimise
	--enable-profiling

The option B<--enable-optimise> is recommended for Real Life usage.

If you do

	make all

everything will be compiled, but nothing will be installed.  The
resulting binaries can be found in the subdirectory
F<bin/>.

=head1 RUNNING

LilyPond does use a lot of resources. For operation you need the following:


=over 5

=item *
A fast computer (a full page of music typically takes 1 minute
on my 486/66, using the B<--enable-checking> compile. It's lot slower
than most MusiXTeX preprocessors)

=item *
TeX

=item *
The MusixTeX fonts. (I use those found in MusixTeX
T.59)

=back

Please refer to the man page for more information.

=head1 REDHAT LINUX

RedHat Linux users should be able to get a RPM. A spec file is in
F<make/lilypond.spec>.


=head1 WINDOZE

Windows NT:

you need the cygnus win32 gnu port development stuff; have a look
at http://www.cygnus.com/gnu-win32.

to make LilyPond under, brr, aargh, well, simply type:

	bash configure
	make win32

=head1 PLATFORMS

LilyPond (pl 0.0.39) is known to compile on the following platforms:

	* linux 2.0.28, g++ 2.7.2[.1]
	* aix 4.1, g++ 2.7.2
