<h1>Documentation translations status</h1>

<p>This is an overview of which parts of LilyPond @TOPLEVEL_VERSION@
  documentation are translated; for each documentation section, you
  can read the word count in parentheses, who translated and verified
  it (translation checkers are printed with a smaller font size), how
  much of the original section in English has been translation, how
  up-to-date is the translation, and whether the translation has
  already been updated after Grand Documentation Project (GDP) was
  started.
</p>

<p>Please note that GDP makes a lot of changes to documentation in
  English, therefore translated documentation is mostly not
  up-to-date; however, this does not mean translated documentation is
  inaccurate regarding current LilyPond version, it only means that
  translated docmentation is not synced with documentation in English.
  We do our best to keep translated documentation consistent with
  current LilyPond syntax and features, and will update it per
  section, when GDP processing of the corresponding section in English
  is finished.
