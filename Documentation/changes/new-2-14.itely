Support for using an alternative music font, such as Gonville, is now
added.

@item
In addition to the existing @code{\hspace} markup command,
a new @code{\vspace} command has been added to provide an easy
and flexible way to add vertical space in markups.  This feature
is based on Nicolas Sceaux's work.

@item
The direction of manual beams can be set with @code{^[} and @code{_[}.

Braces in markup can now be selected by point size using the markup commands
@code{\left-brace} and @code{\right-brace}.

  \right-brace #45
}

@item
Intermediate .ps files which are created by LilyPond

@item
Tuplet number formatting functions are now available to print other fractions
and to add notes to the number or fraction:
@lilypond[quote,relative=2]
\once \override TupletNumber #'text =
  #(tuplet-number::non-default-tuplet-denominator-text 7)
\times 2/3 { c4. c4. c4. c4. }

\once \override TupletNumber #'text =
  #(tuplet-number::non-default-tuplet-fraction-text 12 7)
\times 2/3 { c4. c4. c4. c4. }
\once \override TupletNumber #'text =
  #(tuplet-number::append-note-wrapper
