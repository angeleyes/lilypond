This document is written in url(Yodl)(ftp://ftp.lilypond.org/pub/yodl)
and should foremost produce nice LaTeX() output.  In other formats,
such as html, some things will look a bit different, while other
things will be simply left out.  Therefore, the authoritive version of
this document is the PostScript version, produced via LaTeX().  As you
know, url(no gifs due to patent
problems)(http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/gif.html), but the PNG images
should be viewable with any current browser .  )
