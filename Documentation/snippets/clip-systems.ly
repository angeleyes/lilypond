This code shows how to clip (extract) snippets from a full score.

This file needs to be run separately with @code{-dclip-systems}; the
snippets page may not adequately show the results.

The result will be files named
@samp{base-from-start-to-end[-count].eps}.


If system starts and ends are included, they include extents of the
System grob, e.g., instrument names.


Grace notes at the end point of the region are not included.


Regions can span multiple systems.  In this case, multiple EPS files
are generated.
