Some grobs can be accessed @qq{laterally} from within another grob's
callback. These are usually listed as @qq{layout objects} in the
@qq{Internal properties} section of a grob-interface. The function
@code{ly:grob-object} is used to access these grobs.


Demonstrated below are some ways of accessing grobs from within a
NoteHead callback, but the technique is not limited to NoteHeads.
However, the NoteHead callback is particularly important, since it is
the implicit callback used by the @code{\\tweak} command.


The example function defined below (\"display-grobs\") is probably not
that useful, but it demonstrates that the grobs are indeed being
accessed.


Example console output:


-------------------- #-Grob Accidental - #-Grob Arpeggio - #-Grob Stem -
