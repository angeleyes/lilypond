LilyInput -  LilyPond input format

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This page globally documents the the LilyPond input format, mudela.
To get a better impression, please study some examples.

=head2 Overview

General format of a construct:

	BLOCKNAME {  <info to go with this block>   }

Some types allow declarations:

	IDENTIFIER = BLOCKNAME {
		<info to go with this block>
	}

	..

	BLOCKNAME {
		IDENTIFIER
		...
	}


In musicmode, eg,

	''!c8.-"text"_v

and in lyricmode, eg,

	Twin- kle, twin- kle lit- tle star,2

a lot of characters parse differently
than in "command" mode, eg,

	identifier = score { .. }

So you have to signal this to the tokenizer. This is done with
'$'. '$' is a delimiter, which used by the tokenizer only. The same
goes for lyrics, it has a '@' delimiter.

=item *
musicmode: The brace still is used to group grammatical groups.

=item *
musicmode: "word" are preceded by a '\' (backslash)

This means you can write some stuff in a zillion ways:

=item 1.
	$\var = \blockname { ... } $

=item 2.
	var = blockname { $ ... $ } 

=item 3.
	var = $ $ $\blockname {  ... $ } 

=head2 Comments

Not really crystallized; you can use '#' or '%' as line comment

=head2 other

LilyPond first reads 'symbol.ini', which contains declarations crucial
to proper operation of LilyPond (symbol tables, note names).
