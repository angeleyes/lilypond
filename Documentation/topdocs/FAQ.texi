@subsection Where is guile, libguileX, guile-config?

RedHat users need to install guile-1.4 and guile-devel-1.4, Debian
users need to get guile1.4, libguile9 and libguile9-dev.

If you're building from source, you need guile 1.3.4 or newer.  Verify
that the correct guile, guile-config, and libguile* in your PATH and
LD_LIBRARY_PATH (or @file{/etc/ld.so.conf}).

@subsection I upgraded by applying a patch, and now my configure/build breaks.

Patches don't include automatically generated files, i.e. 
@file{configure} and files generated by @file{configure}.  Regenerate them 
yourself:
@example 

    autoconf
    configure
 
@end example 

@subsection I downloaded the windows32 port, and it doesn't match the website!

The website is usually made from the latest snapshots.  Binary releases,
in particular the windows32 binaries, are only made every once in a while.
They may lag several versions behind the latest version.

@subsection Beams, slurs and crescendi are not displayed at all!

XDvi uses GhostScript for displaying PostScript, check that you have
GhostScript installed.  If you use a different DVI viewer (eg, on
Windows), check if it will display embedded PostScript.  Don't worry,
the symbols should appear on the printout.


@bye
