HINTS

* only show verbatim input for syntax/input changes

* try to be as brief possible in those cases

* don't try to provide real-world examples, they often get too big,
which scares away people.

* Write complete sentences.

* only show user-visible changes. 

@end ignore

@item
A new page breaking function, @code{ly:minimal-breaking}, is dedicated
to books with many pages or a lot of texts.

@item
A table of contents is included using @code{\markuplines \table-of-contents}.
Elements are added to it using the @code{\tocItem} command.

@item
Text spreading over several pages is entered using the
@code{\markuplines} keyword. Builtin markup list commands, such as
@code{\justified-lines} or @code{\wordwrap-lines} may be used, and new
ones created using the @code{define-markup-list-command} Scheme macro.

@item
Particular points of a book may be marked with the @code{\label}
command. Then, the page where these points are placed can be refered to
using the @code{\page-ref} markup command.

@item
Page breaking and page turning commands (@code{\pageBreak},
@code{\noPageBreak}, etc) can be used at top-level, between scores and
top-level markups.

@item
The following options are now changed as a @code{-d} sub-option:
@code{--backend}, @code{--safe}, @code{--preview} and
@code{--no-pages} (which became @code{-dno-print-pages}).  The @code{-b}
option does not exist any more.

@item
Improved testing procedure now catch changes in CPU and memory
performance, page layout, MIDI results and warnings.  This helps to
reduce the number of regression errors during development, resulting
in more stable releases.

See @uref{INSTALL.html#testing} for more information.
@item
Nested properties, such as @code{details} in @code{Slur}, can be
reverted as well.  The syntax for this is

@example
\revert Slur #'(details closeness-factor)
@end example

@item
All line spanners are more flexible now in the configuration of their
end points.  This includes glissando, voice followers, text crescendos
and other text spanners.

@c  with ragged-right we can't see the gliss.

@item
The environment variable LILYPONDPREFIX has been renamed to
LILYPOND_DATADIR.

@item
Notes or rests, such as a typical end note, that fill an entire
measure are preceded by some more space.

@lilypond[ragged-right]
\relative c' {
  \time 4/4
  s1
  c2. c4
  \time 3/4
  c2.
}
@end lilypond

@item All @code{\score}s in a lilypond-book fragment are now inserted
into the document. Also, toplevel markups don't result in an entire
page.

@item Alterations (such as a sharp and flat) may now be arbitrary
fractions. This allows some forms of microtonal music.  For example,
Turkish makam music uses 1/9th tone alterations.

@lilypondfile{makam.ly}



@item Tie directions may be set with @code{^~} and @code{_~}

@item Tablature now supports harmonics and slides,

@lilypond[fragment,ragged-right,relative=1]
\new TabVoice
{
    <c g'\harmonic> d\2\glissando e\2
}
@end lilypond

@item Horizontal spacing now follows object outlines more
accurately. This allows tighter horizontal spacing.

@lilypond[fragment,ragged-right]
{
  \stemUp c''4...*1/2
  ceses'!
}
@end lilypond


@item Objects that belong outside of the staff are
now positioned automatically to avoid collisions.

@lilypond[fragment,ragged-right,relative=1]
  c''
  \once \override TextScript #'self-alignment-X = #CENTER
  a,^"this doesn't collide with the c"
  b^"this goes above the previous markup"
  a8_"this goes below the dynamic"
  a\f
@end lilypond

@item Staves are spaced vertically using a skyline algorithm. This helps to avoid
uneven vertical spacing.

@lilypond[ragged-right]

%% todo: fix 'landscape PDF.

\header {

      \repeat unfold 2 {a' b' c'' d''} | b''''1
    }
  }
}
@end lilypond

@item Nested contexts of the same type are now allowed.
This deprecates @code{InnerStaffGroup} and @code{InnerChoirStaff}.
