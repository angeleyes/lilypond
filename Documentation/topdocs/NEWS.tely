@itemize @bullet
@item @textanchor{tie-chords}
Formatting of ties in chords has been improved. Ties no longer collide
with note heads and stems. In addition, it is possible to manually
specify tie formatting

@lilypond[relative=2, fragment,raggedright]
  <a c d f> ~ <a c d f>
  
  \override TieColumn #'tie-configuration =
  #'((0 . -1)  (2 . -1) (5.5 . 1) (7 . 1))
  <b d f g> ~ <b d f g>
@end lilypond

This improvement has been sponsored by Bertalan Fodor, Jay Hamilton,
Kieren MacMillan, Steve Doonan, Trevor Baca, and Vicente Solsona
Dellá.

@item
Formatting of isolated, single ties has been improved. Now, ties avoid
staff lines, flags and dots, without compromising their shape.

@lilypond[fragment,raggedright]
\relative c'' {
  \stemUp
  c16 c2...~ c16 ~ c2... |
  c4~c8 c8~c16 c16~c32 c16.~[ c64]~ c64[ c8..] |
}
@end lilypond

@item  @textanchor{repeat-counter}
With the @code{countPercentRepeats} property,
percent repeats get incremental numbers to indicate the accumulated repeat count.

@lilypond[relative=2,fragment,raggedright]
\set countPercentRepeats = ##t
\repeat percent 4 { c1 }
\time 2/4
\repeat percent 4 { c2 c2 }
@end lilypond

@item
Text scripts such as fingering instructions and dynamics avoid
collisions with slurs

@lilypond[fragment,relative=1]
{
  b_1( f'_1_2_3 c_3_4_5 a)
  b( f'\p b,)
  c-2_\markup { \italic {"cresc."}} ( f_\markup {x} c)
}
@end lilypond

@item
Tuplets can be made to reach the next non-tuplet note by setting the
@code{tupletFullLength}  property,

@lilypond[fragment,relative=2]
\new Voice \with {
  \remove Forbid_line_break_engraver
  allowBeamBreak = ##t
}
{
  \set Score.proportionalNotationDuration = #(ly:make-moment 1 32)
  \set tupletFullLength = ##t
  \times 2/3 { c8[ c c] }
  c4
}
@end lilypond  

This feature was sponsored by Trevor Baca. 

@item
When @code{strict-note-spacing} is set, notes are spaced without regard
for clefs, bar lines, and grace notes. For example,

@lilypond[fragment,relative=2]
\override Score.SpacingSpanner #'strict-note-spacing = ##t 
\new Staff { c8[ c \clef alto c \grace { c16[ c] } c8 c c]  c32[ c32] }
@end lilypond

This feature was sponsored by Trevor Baca. 

@item
Beams support the @code{break-overshoot} property, for example

@lilypond[relative=2,fragment]
\set allowBeamBreak = ##t
\override Beam #'break-overshoot = #'(1.0 . 2.0)
c2.. c8[ \break c]
@end lilypond
 
This feature was sponsored by Trevor Baca. 

@item
Proportional notation is supported.  Notes can be spaced proportional
to their time-difference by assigning a duration to
@code{proportionalNotationDuration}. For example,

@lilypond[relative=2,fragment,raggedright]
<<
  \set Score.proportionalNotationDuration = #(ly:make-moment 1 16)
  \new Staff { c8[ c c c c c]  c4 c2 r2 }
  \new Staff { c2  \times 2/3 { c8 c c } c4 c1 }
>>
@end lilypond

This feature was sponsored by Trevor Baca.

@item 
Symbol sizes (e.g. accidentals) are disregarded for spacing if
@code{uniform-stretching} of the @code{SpacingSpanner} grob is set,


@lilypond[relative=2,fragment]
<<
  \override  Score.SpacingSpanner #'uniform-stretching = ##t 
  \new Staff { c16[ c c c c c c c c c16]  }
  \new Staff {
    \times 6/7 { c16 c c cis c c c }
    c8[ c32 c32 c16]
  }
>>
@end lilypond

@item
Endings of broken tuplet brackets can be tuned.  For example, you can
add arrows to the brackets,

@lilypond[fragment,raggedright,relative=2]
\override TupletBracket
 #'edge-text = #(cons
             (markup #:arrow-head X LEFT #f)
             (markup #:arrow-head X RIGHT #f))
\times 4/5 {
 c c c \bar "empty" \break c c
}
@end lilypond

This feature was sponsored by Trevor Baca.


@item @textanchor{arrow-glyph}
Arrow heads were added to the Feta font.

@lilypond[]
\lyrics {
  \markup {
    filled, to the right:  \hspace #2.0 \fontsize #6 \arrow-head #0 #1 ##t
    open, down: \hspace #2.0 \fontsize #6 \arrow-head #1 #-1 ##f
  }
}
@end lilypond

These glyphs have been sponsored by Trevor Baca.


@item
Nested tuplets are automatically positioned,

@lilypond[fragment,raggedright,relative=2]
\set tupletNumberFormatFunction = #fraction-tuplet-formatter
\times 4/6 {
  a4 a 
  \times 3/5 { a a a a a }
}
@end lilypond

This feature was sponsored by Trevor Baca.

@item
Music expressions can be displayed, in LilyPond notation, using the
new @code{\displayLilyMusic} function. For instance:
@verbatim
\displayLilyMusic \transpose c a, { c d e f }
@end verbatim
will print:
@verbatim
{ a, b, cis d }
@end verbatim

This feature was contributed by Nicolas Sceaux.

@item
The current bar number may be checked with @code{\barNumberCheck}, eg.

@verbatim
\barNumberCheck #22
@end verbatim

@noindent
will print a warning if it doesn't happen in measure 22.
 
@item
If @code{showLastLength} is set, only the last few measures of a piece
are rendered, which speeds up correcting scores. For example, setting

@verbatim
showLastLength = R1*5
\score { ... }
@end verbatim

@noindent
will render only the last five measures (assuming 4/4 time signature)
of a piece.

@itemy @textanchor{simple-melismata}
Melismata can be specified simply in the lyrics now, eg.

@lilypond[relative=1,verbatim,fragment]
{
  c d( e) f e d
} \addlyrics {
  Ky -- _ _ ri e
}
@end lilypond 

This feature was sponsored by Nancho Alvarez 

@item
Suggested accidentals (for notating musica ficta) may be switched on
with @code{suggestAccidentals}

@lilypond[verbatim,fragment,relative=2]
\set suggestAccidentals = ##t
ais bis
@end lilypond 

This feature was sponsored by Nancho Alvarez.

@item
The setting @code{whichBar} and time-bookkeeping is now split into a
@code{Default_bar_line_engraver} and @code{Timing_translator}
respectively.

@item @textanchor{pitched-trill}
Explicit pitches may be added to trills,

@lilypond[relative,verbatim,fragment]
  \pitchedTrill c4\startTrillSpan fis f\stopTrillSpan
@end lilypond 

This feature was sponsored by D. Josiah Boothby and Jamie Bullock

@item
Markup now supports formatting of text paragraphs, using
@code{\wordwrap} and @code{\justify}.

This feature was sponsored by Sven Axelsson.
