@chapter Toplevel README


LilyPond  is a music  typesetter.  It  produces beautiful  sheet music
using  a description  file as  input.   LilyPond  is  part of  the  GNU
Project.

@section Versioning

LilyPond uses a versioning scheme similar to the Linux kernel.  In a
version "x.y.z", an even second number 'y' denotes a stable version.
For development versions 'y' is odd.

Version 1.6 is the latest stable release.

@section Downloading

The primary download site for sourcecode is
@uref{ftp://ftp.lilypond.org/pub/LilyPond/}.

If you have a slow connection, then you are advised to use
@uref{ftp://ftp.xcf.berkeley.edu/pub/xdelta/,xdelta} for patching
source archives; Xdelta (@file{.xd}) files are supplied on the FTP site.

@section Compilation

For compiling and running LilyPond please refer to the installation
instructions.  These instructions can be found when you unpack
lilypond, as @file{lilypond-x.y.z/INSTALL.txt}. They are also
available on the web at
@uref{http://lilypond.org/Documentation/topdocs/out-www/INSTALL.html}.

NOTE: If you downloaded a binary (@file{.rpm} or use the Cygwin
@file{setup.exe} program, then you don't have to compile LilyPond.


@section Documentation

The documentation is available online at
@uref{http://www.lilypond.org/Documentation/out-www/index.html}.

You can also build it locally: follow the instructions under `Building
documentation in the installation instructions.


@section Comments

LilyPond is a long way from finished so we appreciate your criticism,
comments, bugreports, patches, etc. Please send them to the mailing
list, not to us personally.
