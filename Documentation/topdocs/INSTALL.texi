@subsection Precompiled binary packages

Check out @uref{http://lilypond.org/download} for up to date information on
binary packages for your platform.


@section Requirements

@subsection Compilation

In addition to the packages needed for running Lilypond (see below),
you need the following extra packages for building.

When installing a binary package FOO, you may need to install the
FOO-devel, libFOO-dev or FOO-dev package too.

@itemize

@item @uref{http://fontforge.sf.net/,FontForge} 20041211 or newer.

@item @uref{http://www.xs4all.nl/~hanwen/mftrace/,mftrace} (1.1.0 or
newer),

You will need to install some additional packages to get mftrace to
work.

@item @uref{http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/guile.html,GUILE}
(version 1.6.5 or newer).  If you are installing binary packages, you
may need to install guile-devel or guile-dev or libguile-dev too.

@item @TeX{}.

@TeX{} is used as an optional output backend.

Also, @TeX{}'s libkpathsea is used to find the fonts (@file{.mf},
@file{.afm}, @file{.tfm}).  Make sure you have tetex 1.0 or newer
(1.0.6 is known to work).  If you are installing binary packages, you
may need to install tetex-devel, tetex-dev or libkpathsea-dev too.


@item @uref{ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/texinfo/,Texinfo} (version 4.7 or newer).

@item
 @uref{http://gcc.gnu.org/, The GNU c++ compiler} (version 3.1 or
newer).  EGCS and 2.x are known to cause crashes.

@item @uref{http://www.python.org,Python} (version 2.1 or newer).

@item @uref{ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/make/,GNU Make} (version 3.78 or newer).

@item @uref{http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/gettext.html,gettext}.

@item All packages required for running, including development packages with
header files and libraries.

@end itemize

@subsection Running requirements

Running LilyPond requires proper installation of the following
software

@itemize @bullet

@item @uref{http://www.freetype.org/,Freetype} (version 2).
@item @uref{http://www.pango.org/,Pango} (version 1.6 or newer).
@item @uref{http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/guile.html,GUILE}
(version 1.6.5 or newer).
@item @uref{http://www.python.org,Python} (version 2.1 or newer).
@item @uref{http://www.ghostscript.com,Ghostscript} (version 8.15 or
newer).
@end itemize

@subsection Building documentation

You can view the documentation online at
@uref{http://lilypond.org/doc/}, but you can also build it locally.
This process requires a successful compile of lilypond.  The
documentation is built by issuing
@quotation
@example
make web
@end example
@end quotation

Building the website requires some additional tools and packages

@itemize @bullet
@item @uref{http://lilypond.org/download/fonts,ec-fonts-mftraced}
@item The @uref{http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/,netpbm utilities}
@item ImageMagick
@item International fonts (see input/regression/utf-8.ly for hints
about which font packages are necessary for your platform)
@end itemize

The HTML files can be installed into the standard documentation path
by issuing

@quotation
@example
make out=www web-install
@end example
@end quotation


@section Building LilyPond

To install GNU LilyPond, type
@quotation
@example
gunzip -c lilypond-x.y.z | tar xf -
cd lilypond-x.y.z
./configure		# run with --help for applicable options
make
make install
@end example
@end quotation

The most time-consuming part of compiling LilyPond is tracing the
Type1 fonts. You can shortcut this operation by issuing
one of the following commands

@quotation
@example
make -C mf get-pfa                # requires rpm2cpio
make -C mf get-debian-pfa         # may not be up to date
@end example
@end quotation

If you are not root, you should choose a @code{--prefix} argument that
points into your home directory, e.g.
@quotation
@example
./configure --prefix=$HOME/usr
@end example
@end quotation

@ignore
In this case, you have to insert the contents of
@code{buildscripts/out/lilypond-login} or
@code{buildscripts/out/lilypond-profile} into your start up scripts by
hand.
@end ignore


@subsection Configuring for multiple platforms

If you want to build multiple versions of LilyPond with different
configuration settings, you can use the @code{--enable-config=CONF}
option of configure.  You should use @samp{make conf=CONF} to generate
the output in @file{out-CONF}.  Example: Suppose you want to build
with and without profiling, then use the following for the normal
build

@quotation
@example
./configure --prefix=$HOME/usr/ --enable-checking
make
make install
@end example
@end quotation

and for the profiling version, specify a different configuration

@quotation
@example
./configure --prefix=$HOME/usr/ --enable-profiling --enable-config=prof --disable-checking
make conf=prof
make conf=prof install
@end example
@end quotation


@section Emacs mode

An Emacs mode for entering music and running LilyPond is contained in
the source archive in the @file{elisp} directory.  Do @command{make
install} to install it to @var{elispdir}.  The file @file{lilypond-init.el}
should be placed to @var{load-path}@file{/site-start.d/} or appended
to your @file{~/.emacs} or @file{~/.emacs.el}.

As a user, you may want add your source path (e.g. @file{~/site-lisp/}) to
your @var{load-path} by appending the following line (as modified) to your
@file{~/.emacs}
@c any reason we do not advise:  (push "~/site-lisp" load-path)
@quotation
@example
(setq load-path (append (list (expand-file-name "~/site-lisp")) load-path))
@end example
@end quotation


@section Vim mode

A Vim mode for entering music and running LilyPond is contained in the
source archive in @code{$VIM} directory.  For version 6.2 and newer,
Vim-mode works directly after installing LilyPond.  Otherwise,
complete the following two steps.

For earlier versions (and if @code{$VIM} environment variable does not
fall-back to @file{/usr/local/share/vim}, see @code{:version} in vim),
the LilyPond file type is detected if your file @file{~/.vim/filetype.vim} @c
has the following content
@quotation
@example
if exists("did_load_filetypes")
  finish
endif
augroup filetypedetect
  au! BufNewFile,BufRead *.ly           setf lilypond
augroup END
@end example
@end quotation
If Vim has been (pre-)installed to @file{/usr/...} (or any other place)
instead of @file{/usr/local/...}, then @file{/usr/local/share/vim} may not
be specified in your @code{$VIMRUNTIME} environment variable and you have to
include this path explicitly by appending the following line to your
@file{~/.vimrc}
@quotation
@example
set runtimepath+=/usr/local/share/vim/
@end example
@end quotation

@section Problems

For help and questions use @email{lilypond-user@@gnu.org}.  Send bug
reports to @email{bug-lilypond@@gnu.org}.

Bugs that are not fault of LilyPond are documented here.

@subsection Bison 1.875

There is a bug in bison-1.875: compilation fails with "parse error
before `goto'" in line 4922 due to a bug in bison. To fix, either
recompile bison 1.875 with the following fix

@quotation
@example
$ cd lily; make out/parser.cc
$ vi +4919 out/parser.cc
# append a semicolon to the line containing "__attribute__ ((__unused__))
# save
$ make
@end example
@end quotation

@subsection Linking to kpathsea

If kpathsea and the corresponding header files are installed in some
directory where GCC does not search by default, for example in
@file{/usr/local/lib/} and @file{/usr/local/include/} respectively,
you have to explicitly tell configure where to find it.  To do this

@itemize
@item @code{rm config.cache}
@item @code{export LDFLAGS=-L/usr/share/texmf/lib}
@item @code{export CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/share/texmf/include}
@item @code{./configure}
@end itemize
Once configure has found them, the paths are stored in
@file{config.make} and will be used even if you don't have the
environment variables set during make.


@unnumberedsubsec Gcc-3.0.4

Gcc 3.0.4 is flaky; upgrade GCC.

@unnumberedsubsec Flex-2.5.4a and gcc-3.x

Flex 2.5.4a does not produce g++-3.1.1 compliant C++ code.  To compile
LilyPond with gcc-3.1.1 or higher you may do

@quotation
@example
CONF=gcc-3.1 ./lexer-gcc-3.1.sh
CPPFLAGS=-I$(pwd)/lily/out-gcc-3.1 CC=gcc-3.1 CXX=g++-3.1 \
./configure --enable-config=gcc-3.1
CONF=gcc-3.1 ./lexer-gcc-3.1.sh
make conf=gcc-3.1
@end example
@end quotation


@unnumberedsubsec OpenBSD

@itemize @bullet
@item
Refer to the section ``Linking to kpathsea'': GCC on OpenBSD doesn't
set include paths for kpathsea.
@end itemize

@unnumberedsubsec NetBSD

@itemize @bullet
@item The flex precompiled in NetBSD-1.4.2 is broken.
Upgrade to flex-2.5.4a.
@end itemize

@unnumberedsubsec  Solaris

@itemize @bullet
@item Solaris7, ./configure

@file{./configure} needs a POSIX compliant shell.  On Solaris7,
@file{/bin/sh} is not yet POSIX compliant, but @file{/bin/ksh} or bash
is.  Run configure like
@quotation
@example
	CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/ksh ksh -c ./configure
@end example
@end quotation
or
@quotation
@example
	CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/bash bash -c ./configure
@end example
@end quotation

@end itemize

@bye
