@chapter INSTALL - compiling and installing GNU LilyPond


@section Abstract

This document explains what you need to install LilyPond, and what you
should do.  If you are going to compile and install LilyPond often,
e.g. when doing development, you might want to check out the 
@file{buildscripts/set-lily.sh} script.  It sets some environment 
variables and symlinks, which comes in handly when you have to compile 
LilyPond more often.  

@section Obtaining

You can get the latest version of LilyPond at
@uref{ftp://ftp.cs.uu.nl/pub/GNU/LilyPond/,
ftp://ftp.cs.uu.nl/pub/GNU/LilyPond/}.


@emph{If you upgrade by patching do remember to rerun autoconf after
applying the patch}.

If you do not want to download the entire archive for each version, the
safest method for upgrading is to use @file{xdelta}, see
@uref{ftp://ftp.xcf.berkeley.edu/pub/xdelta/}.

The following command produces @file{lilypond-1.1.55.tar.gz} from
@file{lilypond-1.1.54} identical (up to compression dates) to the .55 on
the FTP site.
@example
  xdelta patch lilypond-1.1.54-1.1.55.xd lilypond-1.1.54.tar.gz
@end example

@section Prerequisites

For compilation you need:

@itemize @bullet
@item A GNU system: GNU LilyPond is known to run on these GNU systems: Linux
    (PPC, intel), FreeBSD, AIX, NeXTStep, IRIX, Digital Unix and
Solaris.

@item Lots of disk space: LilyPond takes between 30 and 100 mb to
compile if you use debugging information.  If you are short on
disk-space run configure with @code{--disable-debugging}.

@item
Although we recommend to use Unix, LilyPond is known to run on Windows
NT/95/98 as well.  See Section Windows NT/95,es.

@item  EGCS 1.1 or newer. Check out @uref{ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gcc/}.

@item  Python 1.5,
Check out
@uref{ftp://ftp.python.org} or @uref{ftp://ftp.cwi.nl/pub/python}.

@item  GUILE 1.3.4,  check out @uref{http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/guile.html,http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/guile.html}.

@item GNU make. 
Check out @uref{ftp://ftp.gnu.org/make/,ftp://ftp.gnu.org/make/}.

@item Flex (version 2.5.4 or newer). 
Check out @uref{ftp://ftp.gnu.org/flex/,ftp://ftp.gnu.org/flex/}.

@item Bison (version 1.25 or newer).
Check out @uref{ftp://ftp.gnu.org/bison/,ftp://ftp.gnu.org/bison/}.

@item Texinfo. Check out @uref{ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/texinfo/,ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/texinfo/}.
Most documentation is in texinfo.

@item The geometry package for LaTeX is needed to use ly2dvi.  
Available at 
@uref{ftp://ftp.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/geometry,ftp://ftp.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/geometry}
or at mirror site @uref{ftp://ftp.dante.de,ftp://ftp.dante.de}

@item MetaPost, if you want to use direct PostScript output. Please
note  that  tetex-0.4pl8 (included with Redhat 5.x) does not include
@file{mfplain.mp}, which is needed  for producing the scaleable font files.

@end itemize

@section Running

GNU LilyPond does use a lot of resources. For operation you need the
following software

@itemize @bullet
@item TeX
@item A PostScript printer and/or viewer (such as Ghostscript) is strongly
    recommended.  Xdvi will show all embedded PostScript too if you have
    Ghostscript installed.
@item  GUILE 1.3.4, check out @uref{http://www.gnu.org/programs/guile.html,http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/}
@end itemize

For running LilyPond successfully you have to help TeX and MetaFont
find various files.  The recommended way of doing so is adjusting the
environment variables in the start-up scripts of your shell.  An
example is given here for the Bourne shell:
@example 
export MFINPUTS="/usr/local/share/lilypond/mf:"
export TEXINPUTS="/usr/local/share/lilypond/tex:/usr/local/share/lilypond/ps:"
 
@end example 

The empty path component
represents TeX and MetaFont's default search paths.  Scripts with
the proper paths for the bourne and C-shell respectively are generated in
@file{buildscripts/out/lilypond-profile} and
@file{buildscripts/out/lilypond-login} during compilation. 

LilyPond is a hiddeously big, slow and bloated program.  A fast CPU
and plenty of RAM is recommended for comfortable use.

@section Website

The website is the most convenient form to use for reading the
documentation on-line documentation. It is made by entering @example 

  make website
 
@end example 
This does require a fully functioning

If you want to auto-generate Lily's website, you'll need some additional
conversion tools.

@itemize @bullet
@item xpmtoppm (from the Portable Bitmap Utilities) (For RedHat Linux
	     users: it is included within the package libgr-progs).
	the original is at
@uref{ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/utilities/netpbm-1mar1994.p1.tar.gz,ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/utilities/netpbm-1mar1994.p1.tar.gz}

@item pnmtopng, which is also in libgr-progs for RedHat. The original is
at
@uref{ftp://swrinde.nde.swri.edu/pub/png/applications/pnmtopng-2.37.2.tar.gz,ftp://swrinde.nde.swri.edu/pub/png/applications/pnmtopng-2.37.2.tar.gz}.i

The version of @file{pnmtopng} that is distributed with RedHat 5.1 and
5.2 contains a bug: pnmtopng is dynamically linked to the wrong
version of libpng, which results in cropped images.  Recompile it from 
source, and make sure that the pnmtopng binary is linked statically to 
the libpng that is included in libgr.  RedHat 6.0 does not have this 
problem.

@example 
 tar xzf libgr-2.0.13.tar.gz
      make
      cd png
      rm libpng.so*
      make pnmtopng
 
@end example 

You can then install the new pnmtopng into @file{/usr/local/bin/}

@item Bib2html @uref{http://pertsserver.cs.uiuc.edu/~hull/bib2html.,http://pertsserver.cs.uiuc.edu/~hull/bib2html.}
    Which, in turn depends on man2html for proper installation.
man2html can be had from @uref{http://askdonald.ask.uni-karlsruhe.de/hppd/hpux/Networking/WWW/Man2html-1.05,http://askdonald.ask.uni-karlsruhe.de/hppd/hpux/Networking/WWW/Man2html-1.05}.

The website will build without this utility, but you will not see our
hypertextified bibliography.

@item Doc++ (optional) to read the source code.

@end itemize

@section Configuring and compiling

to install GNU LilyPond, simply type:
@example 

	gunzip -c lilypond-x.y.z | tar xf -
	cd lilypond-x.y.z
	./configure		# fill in your standard prefix with --prefix
	make
	make install
 
@end example 

This will install a number of files, something close to:

@example 
	/usr/local/man/man1/mi2mu.1
	/usr/local/man/man1/convert-mudela.1
	/usr/local/man/man1/mudela-book.1
	/usr/local/man/man1/lilypond.1
	/usr/local/bin/lilypond
	/usr/local/bin/mi2mu
	/usr/local/bin/convert-mudela
	/usr/local/bin/mudela-book
	/usr/local/bin/abc2ly
	/usr/local/share/lilypond/*
	/usr/local/share/locale/@{it,nl@}/LC_MESSAGES/lilypond.mo
@end example 


The above assumes that you are root and have the GNU development
tools, and your make is GNU make.  If this is not the case, you can
adjust your environment variables to your taste:

@example 

	export CPPFLAGS="-I /home/me/my_include -DWEIRD_FOOBAR" 
	./configure
 
@end example 

@code{CPPFLAGS} are the preprocessor flags. 

The configure script is Cygnus configure, and it will accept
@code{--help}. If you are not root, you will probably have to make it
with a different @code{--prefix} option.  Our favourite location is

@example 

	./configure --prefix=$HOME/usr
 
@end example 

In this case, you will have to set up MFINPUTS, and TEXINPUTS accordingly.

Since GNU LilyPond currently is beta, you are advised to also use

@example 

	--enable-debugging
	--enable-checking
 
@end example 

Options to configure include:

@table @samp
@item @code{--enable-printing}
    Enable debugging print routines (lilypond @code{-D} option)
@item @code{--enable-optimise}
    Set maximum optimisation: compile with @code{-O2}.  This can be
unreliable on some compiler/platform combinations (eg, DEC Alpha and PPC)
@item @code{--enable-profiling}
    Compile with support for profiling.
@item @code{--enable-config}
    Output to a different configuration file.  Needed for multi-platform
    builds
@end table

All options are documented in the @file{configure} help
The option @code{--enable-optimise} is recommended for Real Life usage.

If you do

@example 

	make all
 
@end example 

everything will be compiled, but nothing will be installed.  The
resulting binaries can be found in the subdirectories @file{out/} (which
contain all files generated during compilation).

@section Configuring for multiple platforms

If you want to compile LilyPond with different configuration settings,
then, you can use the @code{--enable-config} option.  Example: suppose I
want to build with and   without profiling.  Then I'd use the
following for the normal build, 

@example 

      ./configure --prefix=~ --disable-optimise --enable-checking
      make
      make install
      
@end example 

and for the profiling version, I specify a different configuration.

@example 

      ./configure --prefix=~ --enable-profiling --enable-config=optprof --enable-optimise --disable-checking
      make config=optprof
      make config=optprof install
 
@end example 


@section Installing

if you have done a successful @code{make}, then a simple

@example 

	make install
 
@end example 

should do the trick.

If you are doing an upgrade, please remember to remove obsolete
@file{.pk} and @file{.tfm} files of the fonts.  A script has been
provided to do the work for you, see @file{bin/clean-fonts.sh}.


@section Redhat linux

RedHat Linux users can compile an RPM. A spec file is in
@file{make/out/lilypond.spec}, it is distributed along with the
sources.

You can make the rpm by issuing
@example 

	rpm -tb lilypond-x.y.z.tar.gz
	rpm -i /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/lilypond-x.y.z
 
@end example 

Precompiled i386 RedHat RPMS are available from
@uref{ftp://freshmeat.net/pub/rpms/lilypond/,ftp://freshmeat.net/pub/rpms/lilypond/} and
@uref{http://linux.umbc.edu/software/lilypond/rpms/,http://linux.umbc.edu/software/lilypond/rpms/}.

For compilation on a RedHat system you need these packages,
in addition to the those needed for running:
@itemize @bullet
@item glibc-devel
@item libstdc++-devel
@item guile-devel
@item flex
@item bison
@item texinfo
@end itemize

@section Debian GNU/linux

A Debian package is also available; contact Anthony Fok
@email{foka@@debian.org}.  The build scripts are in the subdirectory
@file{debian/}.

@section Windows NT/95

Separate instructions on building for W32 are available; See the files
in @file{Documentation/ntweb/}, included with the sources.

@section Problems

For help and questions use @email{help-gnu-music@@gnu.org} and
@email{gnu-music-discuss@@gnu.org}.  Please consult the faq before
mailing your problems.

If you find bugs, please send bug reports to
@email{bug-gnu-music@@gnu.org}.

Known bugs that are LilyPond's fault are listed in @file{TODO}, or
demonstrated in @file{input/bugs/}.

Known bugs that are not LilyPond's fault are documented here.


@unnumbered LinuxPPC Bugs:

@itemize
@item egcs-1.1.2-12c (stock LinuxPPC R5) has a serious bug, upgrade to 
fixed in egcs-1.1.2-12f or gcc-2.95-0a, @uref{ftp://dev.linuxppc.org/users/fsirl/R5/RPMS/ppc/}

@item egcs-1.0.2 (LinuxPPC R4):
all compiling with @code{-O2} is suspect, in particular guile-1.3, and
Lily herself will break.
@end itemize



@unnumbered Linux-i386

@itemize
@item SuSE6.2 and similar platforms (glibc 2.1, libstdc++ 2.9.0)

Lily will crash during parsing (which suggests a C++ library
incompatibility).  Precise cause, precise platform description or
solution are not known.

Note that this only happens on some computers with the said platform.

@item libg++ 2.7

LilyPond occasionally crashes while parsing the initialisation files.
This is a very obscure bug, and usually entering the commandline
differently "fixes" it.

@example
	lilypond input.ly 
@end  example

and
@example
	lilypond -I. ./input.ly 
@end example
makes a difference

Typical stacktrace:
@example
	SIGSEGV
	__libc_malloc (bytes=16384)
	?? ()
	yyFlexLexer::yy_create_buffer ()
	Includable_lexer::new_input (this=0x8209a00, s=@{strh_ = @{
@end example

This behaviour has been observed with machines that have old libg++
versions (LinuxPPC feb '98, RedHat 4.x).  
@end itemize




@unnumbered Solaris:

@itemize
@item Sparc64/Solaris 2.6, GNU make-3.77

GNU make-3.77 is buggy on this platform, upgrade to 3.78.1 or newer.


@item Sparc64/Solaris 2.6, ld

Not yet resolved.
@end itemize


@unnumbered AIX

@itemize
@item AIX 4.3 ld

The following is from the gcc install/SPECIFIC file.
@quotation
   Some versions of the AIX binder (linker) can fail with a relocation
   overflow severe error when the -bbigtoc option is used to link
   GCC-produced object files into an executable that overflows the TOC. A
   fix for APAR IX75823 (OVERFLOW DURING LINK WHEN USING GCC AND  
   -BBIGTOC) is available from IBM Customer Support and from its
   27service.boulder.ibm.com website as PTF U455193.   

   Binutils does not support AIX 4.3 (at least through release 2.9). GNU
   as and GNU ld will not work properly and one should not configure GCC
   to use those GNU utilities. Use the native AIX tools which do
   interoperate with GCC.
@end quotation

add -Wl,-bbigtoc to USER_LDFLAGS, ie:
@example
    LDFLAGS='-Wl,-bbigtoc' ./configure
@end example

@end itemize
