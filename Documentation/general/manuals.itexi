This book explains how to begin learning LilyPond, as well as
explaining some key concepts in easy terms.  You should read these
chapters in a linear fashion.

There is a paragraph @strong{See also} at the end of each section,
which contains cross-references to other sections: you should not
follow these cross-references at first reading.  When you have
read all of the manual, you may want to read some sections again
and follow those cross-references for more information.

@subheading Introductory questions

@subsubheading Where are the graphical canvas, menus, and toolbars?

LilyPond requires you to write music as text.  Please read about
our @ref{Text input}.


@subsubheading There's a lot of documentation!  Do I need to read it?

You need to read the @ref{Learning, Learning manual}.  As for the
rest of documentation, you only need to read the sections which
discuss the notation that you wish to create.


@subsubheading That's still a lot of reading!  Is it worth it?

Please decide for yourself; the reasons why you might want to use
LilyPond are given in the @ref{Introduction}.

This is a set of heavily cross linked HTML pages which document

and function.  It is produced directly from the formatting
definitions in the source code.

Almost all formatting functionality that is used internally is
available directly to the user.  For example, most variables that
control thickness values, distances, etc., can be changed in input
files.  There are a huge number of formatting options, and all of
them are described in this document.  Each section of the Notation
Reference has a @b{See also} subsection, which refers to the
generated documentation.  In the HTML document, these subsections
have clickable links.
