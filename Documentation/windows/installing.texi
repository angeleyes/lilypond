@chapter WINDOWS - Installing GNU LilyPond on Windows

This document explains how to install the binary release for windows on
a Microsoft Windows 95, 98, NT or 2000 machine. Please follow the
instructions carefully. If it doesn't work for you, please send a
bugreport, following the guidelines in the section on bugreports below.


@section Windows binary setup 

If you run Windows NT, 2000 or XP, please become administrator first
(currently, installing as an ordinary user will not work).  Download and
run @uref{http://www.lilypond.org/gnu-windows/setup.exe, setup.exe}.
You will be asked some questions. If you are unsure just click "Next".
Do not change the default install directory @file{c:/cygwin}.

This installs LilyPond, and Cygwin, GUILE, Python, teTeX (MikTeX is not
supported) and GSView.  If you already have some of that software under
@file{c:/cygwin}, then don't worry: nothing will be installed twice.

If you want to install any of this software by hand, do this
@strong{before} you run @file{setup.exe}, otherwise your LilyPond setup
may not work.

@section Testing LilyPond

Open a LilyPond shell (To open a a lilypond shell, click the "GNU
LilyPond" icon), and type

@quotation
@example
lilypond --help
@end example
@end quotation

You should see something similar to

@quotation
@example
Usage: lilypond [OPTION]... [FILE]...

Typeset music and or play MIDI from FILE

LilyPond is a music typesetter.  It produces beautiful sheet music
using a high level description file as input.  LilyPond is part of 
the GNU Project.

Options:
  -h,--help             this help
[..]
@end example
@end quotation

Then, prepare a file called @file{foo.ly}, by issuing
@quotation
@example
notepad foo.ly
@end example
@end quotation
Enter the following into the file
@quotation
@example

\score @{ \notes @{ c4 ( ) c4 @} @}

@end example
@end quotation
Close the file and save it. Run the following command. It should say
@code{PS output to `foo.ps', DVI output to `foo.dvi'}.
@quotation
@example

ly2dvi -P foo

@end example
@end quotation
You can now view the file using the following command
@quotation
@example

gsview32 foo.ps

@end example
@end quotation

If this works, then you can head to the
@uref{../../user/out-www/lilypond/Tutorial.html,Tutorial} to start using
LilyPond.



@section Removing LilyPond

Start @file{setup.exe}, click Next, select "Install from Local
Directory". Then click next until you reach "Select packages to
install". Click "View". Now, for every package, click on the recycle
icon until it says "Uninstall". Then, click Next.

(If you find this too tedious, you can also simply remove
@file{c:/cygwin}. This also removes the @file{/home/} directories under
cygwin (i.e. @file{C:\CYGWIN\HOME}, so make sure that you bring
important files in safety first.)

@section Bugreports

We can only help you with a problem if you give a full, detailed
bugreport. A bugreport includes

@itemize @bullet
@item A @emph{precise} description of the problem.  
@item A full description of your platform (machine type, operating
system)
@item All version numbers of relevant software you run.  Specifically, we
want to see the output of the  following commands: 
@quotation
@example
  python --version
  lilypond --version
  ly2dvi --version
  gswin32c  --version
@end example
@end quotation
@item If ly2dvi fails, then please run it as follows and include the
  output in the 
@quotation
@example
  ly2dvi --verbose MY-FILE
@end example
@end quotation
@end itemize

You can also check out
@uref{http://lilypond.org/wiki/?TroubleshootingWindows} for more
instructions on how to make a bug report.

@subsection Additional software

LilyPond needs a number of software packages to be really useful.  These
are included in the binary setup program (see above).

If you choose to install this additional software yourself, make sure
you install LilyPond last, otherwise the LilyPond setup will be broken.
Also note that this means that you will probably need to fix some PATH
and TEX environment variables yourself.  If you think you can handle
that, you may do so, but don't complain if it doesn't work.

These software packages are included in the LilyPond installation:

@table @asis
@item A full TeX installation.

As of LilyPond versions 1.4.11 (and 1.5.29), only Cygwin's teTeX
installation is supported (packages tetex-beta and texmf-base).  It is
part of Cygwin and much more robust for use with LilyPond than MiKTeX.
See @file{/usr/doc/Cygwin/tetex-beta-20001218.README} and
@file{/usr/doc/Cygwin/texmf-20000804-2.README} for details.

@item Ghostview.

You can use GSView-2.6.  This old package has two advantages.  It has
gsview and ghostscript bundeled, and it doesn't popup @emph{Register
Now|Cancel} windows all the time.  It doesn't work together with Yap to
display PostScript specials.

Click @uref{ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/ghost/ghostgum/gsv26w32.exe,here} to
install GSView-2.6 (GhostView for Windows), or visit
@uref{ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/ghost/ghostgum,ftp.cs.wisc.edu}.

You can also use the newer versions GSView-3.6 and GhostScript-6.50 If
you install both these packages, Yap will display PostScript specials.
You get annoying @emph{Register Now|Cancel} popups, though.

Click @uref{ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/ghost/ghostgum/gsv36w32.exe,here} for
GSview and 
Click @uref{ftp://mirror.cs.wisc.edu/pub/mirrors/ghost/AFPL/gs650/gs650w32.exe
,here} for GhostScript.
@uref{ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/ghost/ghostgum,ftp.cs.wisc.edu}.
or visit the
@uref{http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/,Ghostscript, Ghostview and GSview site}.

Mats?

Let's take this step by step.

It should not be critical which MikTeX version you use.
Let's first verify that your MikTeX works as it should.
Open a DOS window. Run the commands
>> latex sample2e
 Should produce some lines of output
>> yap sample2e
 Should display a three page document.

Next step; verify that the geometry package is in place. 
Save the attached file to the directory where you run 
your DOS window. Run the commands
>> latex geometrytest
>> yap geometrytest
This one you should get a single page document with some text
in each corner.

This will install the minimal set of cygwin tools needed to run
LilyPond.  Make sure to install in the default place, @file{c:/cygwin},
and install everything.
