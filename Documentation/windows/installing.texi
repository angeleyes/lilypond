@chapter WINDOWS - Installing GNU LilyPond on Windows

This document explains how to install the binary release for windows
on a Microsoft Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000 or XP machine.  Please
follow the instructions carefully.  If it doesn't work for you, please
send a bugreport, following the guidelines in the section on
bugreports below.

@section QuickInstall

Click @uref{http://cygwin.com/setup.exe, Install Lily now}, run the
installer (@file{setup.exe}), and in the Package View dialogue, select
LilyPond, found in the Publishing section.

If you have any problems, please read the rest of this page.

@section Windows binary setup 

The binary LilyPond setup for Windows is in fact a
@uref{http://cygwin.com, Cygwin} installation, including the LilyPond
package for Cygwin.

If you run Windows NT, 2000 or XP, please become administrator first
(currently, installing as an ordinary user will not work).  Download
and run @uref{http://cygwin.com/setup.exe, setup.exe}.  You will be
asked some questions.  If you are unsure just click "Next".  Do not
change the default install directory @file{c:/cygwin}.

In the Package View dialogue window, click on the Publishing section
to view the available publishing software for Cygwin.  Make sure that
LilyPond is selected.  If this is a new or first installation, click
on @emph{Skip} to select.

This installs LilyPond, and Cygwin, GUILE, Python, teTeX (MikTeX is not
supported).  If you already have some of that software under
@file{c:/cygwin}, then don't worry: nothing will be installed twice.

@subsection Additional software

If you install the Cygwin's XFree86 X11 window system, tetex-x11 and
ghostscript-x11 packages too, you can view the @code{dvi} output doing
@code{xdvi test.dvi}.

LilyPond needs a PostScript/PDF viewer to be really useful.  At this
time (Sun Aug 11 2002), such software is not available in Cygwin, so
you must use native Windows software instead.

@table @samp
@item Ghostview.

You can use GSView-2.6.  This old package has two advantages.  It has
gsview and ghostscript bundeled, and it doesn't popup @emph{Register
Now|Cancel} windows all the time.

Install @uref{ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/ghost/ghostgum/gsv26w32.exe, GSView-2.6} (GhostView for Windows), or visit
@uref{ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/ghost/ghostgum,ftp.cs.wisc.edu}.

@c check/update versions
You can also use the newer versions GSView-3.6 and GhostScript-6.50,
which can also display PDFs.  You get annoying @emph{Register
Now|Cancel} popups, though.

Install
@uref{ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/ghost/ghostgum/gsv36w32.exe,GSview-3.6}
and
@uref{ftp://mirror.cs.wisc.edu/pub/mirrors/ghost/AFPL/gs650/gs650w32.exe,
GhostScript-6.50}, or visit the @uref{http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/,
Ghostview and GSview site}.

@section Testing LilyPond

Open a LilyPond shell (To open a a lilypond shell, click the "GNU
LilyPond" or "Cygwin" icon), and type

@quotation
@example
lilypond --help
@end example
@end quotation

You should see something similar to

@quotation
@example
GNU LilyPond 1.6.0
Usage: lilypond [OPTION]... FILE...

Typeset music and or play MIDI from FILE

LilyPond is a music typesetter.  It produces beautiful sheet music
using a high level description file as input.  LilyPond is part of 
the GNU Project.

Options:
  -h,--help             this help
[..]
@end example
@end quotation

Then, prepare a file called @file{foo.ly}, by issuing
@quotation
@example
notepad foo.ly
@end example
@end quotation
Enter the following into the file
@quotation
@example

\score @{ \notes @{ c4 ( ) c4 @} @}

@end example
@end quotation
Close the editor and save the file.  Then run the following command.
@quotation
@example
ly2dvi -p foo
@end example
@end quotation
At the end, it should say
@quotation
@example
DVI output to `foo.dvi'...
PS output to `foo.ps'...
PDF output to `foo.pdf'...
@end example
@end quotation
If you install the Cygwin's XFree86 X11 window system, tetex-x11 and
ghostscript-x11 packages too, you can view the @code{dvi} output doing
@code{xdvi test.dvi}.  If you have installed a PostScript/PDF viewer,
such as @code{GSView} from @uref{http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost},
viewing the PS file can be done with:
@quotation
@example
gsview32 foo.ps
@end example
@end quotation

If this works, then you can head to the
@uref{../../user/out-www/lilypond/Tutorial.html,Tutorial}
@ignore
Hmm, this only works for 1.5.73-1 installs.
Cygwin does not yet have an html documentation index, such as dwww.
(@uref{file:///c/cygwin/usr/doc/lilypond-1.5.73-1/html/Documentation/user/out-www/Tutorial.html,
local copy})
@end ignore
to start using LilyPond.

@section Removing LilyPond

Start @file{setup.exe}, click Next, select "Install from Local
Directory".  Then click next until you reach "Select packages to
install".  Click "View".  Now, for every package, click on the recycle
icon until it says "Uninstall".  Then, click Next.

(If you find this too tedious, you can also simply remove
@file{c:/cygwin}. This also removes the @file{/home/} directories under
cygwin (i.e. @file{C:\CYGWIN\HOME}, so make sure that you bring
important files in safety first.)

@section Troubleshooting

For problems and solutions see
@uref{http://lilypond.org/wiki?TroubleshootingWindows,Troubleshooting
Windows}

If you have a problem running LilyPond, you should first make sure
that you are running the latest version.  Chances are, that your
problem was already reported and fixed in a newer release.  Click
@uref{http://cygwin.com/setup.exe, Update Lily now} to check if
new software is available.

If you subscribe to the @uref{http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin-announce/,
cygwin-announce (archives)} mailing list, see
@uref{http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/lists.html, Cygwin mailing
lists}, bottom of page.  You'll be notified of new and updated
software for Cygwin, including LilyPond.

Chances are, that a problem you experience has been noted by others.
Cygwin specific problems will be reported to the
@uref{http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin, cygwin-user (archives)} mailing
list (@uref{http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/lists.html, Cygwin mailing
lists}, bottom of page).

LilyPond specific problems, also concering Cygwin/Windows, are
reported and discussed on the
@uref{http://mail.gnu.org/pipermail/lilypond-user, lilypond-user
(archives)} mailing list.

@section Requirements and DLLs

TeTeX and LilyPond depend on a number of library packages, but as it
seems, they sometimes do not get selected automagically.

@itemize @samp
@item teTeX
  requires: ash cygwin ed grep jpeg libkpathsea3 libncurses6 libpng12 tiff
  sed termcap zlib
  
@item LilyPond
  requires: bash libguile14 libiconv2 libintl2 libkpathsea3 python
  tetex-bin, tetex-tiny or tetex-base
@end itemize

@multitable @columnfractions .40 .40

@section Bugreports

So you have checked by running @uref{http://cygwin.com/setup.exe,
Update Lily now} that you run the latest version, and
@uref{http://lilypond.org/wiki?TroubleshootingWindows,Troubleshooting
Windows} nor @uref{http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin, cygwin-user
(archives)} or @uref{http://mail.gnu.org/pipermail/lilypond-user,
lilypond-user (archives)} mentions your problem.  It looks like you
found a bug.

We can only help you with a problem if you give a full, detailed
bugreport. A bugreport includes

@itemize @bullet
@item A @emph{precise} description of the problem.  
@item A full description of your platform (machine type, operating
system)
@item All version numbers of relevant software you run.
      The best way to this is to run
      @quotation
      @example
      sh -x /usr/bin/bug-lilypond-cygwin >& bug.txt
      @end example
      @end quotation
      and include the file @file{bug.txt}.  (If you are running
      lilypond 1.5.73 or earlier, download
      @uref{http://lilypond.org/cygwin/bug-lilypond-cygwin,
      bug-lilypond-cygwin here}.
@end itemize

If you have trouble using bug-lilypond-cygwin, you must gather this
information by hand.  Specifically, we want to see the output of the
following commands:
@itemize @bullet
@item Version info
@quotation
@example
  python --version
  lilypond --version
  ly2dvi --version
@end example
@end quotation
@item If ly2dvi fails, then please run it as follows and include the
  output in the 
@quotation
@example
  ly2dvi --verbose MY-FILE
@end example
@end quotation
@end itemize
