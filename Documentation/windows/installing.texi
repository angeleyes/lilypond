@chapter WINDOWS - Installing GNU LilyPond on Windows

This document explains how to install the binary release for windows
on a Microsoft Windows 95, 98, NT or 2000 machine.

This release is a free extra service of the developers to assist windows
users. Please remember that we (the developers) rather dislike windows,
and none of us use it.  Don't complain to us that installing LilyPond is
too difficult; rather, send us code that works better.

You must install the following software:

@table @asis
@item LilyPond
Download and run
@uref{ftp://ftp.lilypond.org/pub/LilyPond/gnu-windows/setup.exe, setup.exe}
to install LilyPond.

This will install the minimal set of cygwin tools needed to run
LilyPond.  If you already have cygwin installed, don't worry: nothing
will be installed twice.  To expand on this minimal set, click
@uref{http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/setup.exe,here},
or visit a Cygwin
@uref{http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/mirrors.html,mirror site}.

@item A full TeX installation.

For example,  download  and install 
@uref{http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/miktex/miktex-2.0-lvl-1.zip,MikTeX},
or visit @uref{http://www.miktex.org,www.miktex.org}.
@c See @file{/usr/doc/cygwin/tetex-beta-20001218.README} for details.

@item Ghostview.

You can use GSView-2.6.  This old package has two advantages.  It has
gsview and ghostscript bundeled, and it doesn't popup @emph{Register
Now|Cancel} windows all the time.  It doesn't work together with Yap to
display PostScript specials.

Click @uref{ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/ghost/ghostgum/gsv26w32.exe,here} to
install GSView-2.6 (GhostView for Windows), or visit
@uref{ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/ghost/ghostgum,ftp.cs.wisc.edu}.

You can also use the newer versions GSView-3.6 and GhostScript-6.50 If
you install both these packages, Yap will display PostScript specials.
You get annoying @emph{Register Now|Cancel} popups, though.

Click @uref{ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/ghost/ghostgum/gsv36w32.exe,here} for
GSview and 
Click @uref{ftp://mirror.cs.wisc.edu/pub/mirrors/ghost/AFPL/gs650/gs650w32.exe
,here} for GhostScript.
@uref{ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/ghost/ghostgum,ftp.cs.wisc.edu}.
or visit the
@uref{http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/,Ghostscript, Ghostview and GSview site}.

@item Python
Click @uref{http://www.python.org/ftp/python/win32/py152.exe,here} to
install Python-1.5.2, or visit
@uref{http://www.python.org,www.python.org}.

We have not tried using newer versions than 1.5.2.

@section Windows running setup

If you're lucky, after running @file{setup.exe} you're all set up.

Open a LilyPond shell (or any bash shell), and type
@example
lilypond --help
@end example

If you don't see something similar to
@example
Usage: lilypond [OPTION]... [FILE]...

Typeset music and or play MIDI from FILE

LilyPond is a music typesetter.  It produces beautiful sheet music
using a high level description file as input.  LilyPond is part of 
the GNU Project.

Options:
  -h,--help             this help
[..]
@end example

you should try adding @file{/usr/lilypond-x.y.z/bin} to your @var{PATH},
do:
@example
PATH=/usr/lilypond-1.3.147/bin:$PATH
@end example

and try again.

[TODO:


* emacs-mode installation, figure out and describe proper
emacs-on-cygwin setup.

* talk about /etc/profile.d/lilypond-profile.sh

* GUILE errors, simple guile test

* (La)TEX errors, simple tex test

@ignore 

  guile -v
  Guile 1.4.1

  guile -e %load-path

Mats?

Let's take this step by step.

It should not be critical which MikTeX version you use.
Let's first verify that your MikTeX works as it should.
Open a DOS window. Run the commands
>> latex sample2e
 Should produce some lines of output
>> yap sample2e
 Should display a three page document.

Next step; verify that the geometry package is in place. 
Save the attached file to the directory where you run 
your DOS window. Run the commands
>> latex geometrytest
>> yap geometrytest
This one you should get a single page document with some text
in each corner.
