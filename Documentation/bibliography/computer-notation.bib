  note = {Describes the "parser" which converts {MusiCopy} MDL to
  MusiCopy Simultaneities and columns.

MDL is short for Music Description Language\cite{gourlay86}. It
accepts music descriptions that are organised into measures filled
with voices, those filled notes. The measures can be arranged
simultaneously or sequentially.  To address the 2-dimensionality,
almost all constructs in MDL must be labeled.

MDL uses begin/end markers for attribute values and spanners.
Rightfully the author concludes that MusiCopy must administrate a
"state" variable containing both properties and current spanning symbols.

MusiCopy attaches graphic information to the objects constructed in
the input: the elements of the input are partially complete graphic
objects.

Since the design goals of both LilyPond and MusiCopy were roughly the
same, both systems have superficial similarities: the details of the
input format, the notation of "musical state".  However, LilyPond
stresses extensibility, modularity and separation between content and
presentation much more, and this shows: LilyPond is more flexible.  To
be fair: development of MusiCopy was abandoned in 1987, so it is not
surprising that LilyPond is more mature.
