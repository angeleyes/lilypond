Artificial harmonics are notated with a different note head style.  They
are entered by marking the harmonic pitch with @code{\harmonic}.

@subsubsection Harp

Sacred Harp notation uses four shaped note heads.  In the major,
the tonic is a triangle and then proceeding up the scale you
have circle, square, triangle, circle, square, diamond.  In the
minor, the shapes should be assigned to keep the same interval
relationships, e.g. you assign them for the relative major.  (This
means that the scale in the minor gives the tonic a square.)

@c TODO add example of \sacredHarpHeads, or a ref?


@knownissues

The \sacredHarpHeads command gives the wrong shapes when the key
is minor.  A work-around is to switch the key to the relative
major to obtain the right shapes.
