@cindex orchestral strings
@cindex strings, writing for

This section provides information and references which are helpful
when writing for unfretted string instruments, principally
orchestral strings.

@node Common notation for unfretted strings
@subsection Common notation for unfretted strings

There is little specialist notation for unfretted string
instruments.  The music is notated on a single staff, and
usually only a single voice is required.  Two voices might
be required for some double-stopped or divisi passages.

Most of the notation which is useful for orchestral strings
and other bowed instruments is covered elsewhere:

@itemize

@item Texual indications such as @qq{pizz.} and @qq{arco} are
added as simple text -- see @ref{Text scripts}.

@item Fingerings, including the thumb indication, are described
in @ref{Fingering instructions}.

@item When writing for orchestral strings, slurs are used to
indicate passages which should be bowed in a continuous movement.
For details, see @ref{Slurs}.

@item Double stopping is normally indicated by writing a chord,
see @ref{Chorded notes}.  A triple or quadruple stop might be
indicated by a square bracket to indicate the notes should be
played simultaneously rather than arpeggiated.  A square bracket
is also used to indicate the two notes of a double stop should be
played divisi by the two players on the stand.  A bracket arpeggio
can be used to bracket notes together, see @ref{Arpeggio}.

@item For passages which require two voices see @rlearning{I'm
hearing Voices} and @ref{Single-staff polyphony}.

@item A template for a string quartet can be found in
@rlearning{String quartet}.  Others are shown in the snippets.

@cindex bowing indications
@cindex up bow indication
@cindex down bow indication

Bowing indications are created as articulations, which are
described in @ref{Articulations and ornamentations}.  The
bowing commands, @code{\upbow} and @code{\downbow}, are used with
slurs as follows:

@lilypond[verbatim,quote,relative=2]
c4(\downbow d) e(\upbow f)
@end lilypond

@node Harmonics
@unnumberedsubsubsec Harmonics

@funindex \harmonic

@strong{@i{Natural harmonics}}

@cindex natural harmonics
@cindex harmonics, natural

Natural harmonics can be notated in several ways.  A diamond-shaped
note head generally means to touch the string where you would stop
the note if it were not a diamond.  Diamond note heads are created
by placing @code{\harmonic} after the note and enclosing the whole
in angle brackets.
Dotted harmonics indicated with @code{\harmonic} do not show the
dots.  The context property @code{harmonicDots} should be set if
dots are required.


@lilypond[verbatim,quote,relative=2]
<b\harmonic>4 <b\harmonic>2.
\set harmonicDots = ##t
<b\harmonic>4 <b\harmonic>2.
@end lilypond

Alternatively a normal note head is shown at the pitch to be
sounded together with a small circle to indicate it should be
played as a harmonic:

@lilypond[verbatim,quote,relative=2]
d4^\flageolet d_\flageolet
@end lilypond

A smaller circle may be created, see the snippet list in
@ref{References for unfretted strings}.

@strong{@i{Artificial harmonics}}

@cindex artificial harmonics
@cindex harmonics, artifical

Artificial harmonics are notated with two notes, one with a normal
note head indicating the stopped position and one with an open
diamond note head to indicate the harmonic position.
They are entered by marking the harmonic pitch with @code{\harmonic}.
Note the @code{\harmonic} command must be placed within the angle
brackets signifying the chord.  The example shows the notation for a
fourth and a fifth harmonic.

@lilypond[verbatim,quote,relative=1]
<e a\harmonic>2  <c g'\harmonic>
@end lilypond
