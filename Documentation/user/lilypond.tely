HINTS FOR STYLE

* Try not to use punctuation between introductocing sentence and
display material (verbatim, music, example code).

* don't refer to LilyPond in the text. The reader knows what the
manual is about

* if you do, capitalization is LilyPond.

* don't explicitly refer to the reader/user.  There is no one else
besides the reader and the writer.

* don't use abbreviations (don't, won't, etc.)

* avoid fluff (``Notice that,'' ``as you can see,'' ``Currently,'') 

* avoid long stretches of input code. Noone is go to read  them in
print. Instead refer to an example input file (@inputfileref), these
are clickable in HTML.

* abbrevs in caps, e.g. HTML, DVI, MIDI, etc.
