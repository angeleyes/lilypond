HINTS FOR STYLE

* Do not forget to create @cindex entries for new sections of text.

* Try not to use punctuation between introductocing sentence and
display material (verbatim, music, example code).

* Do not refer to LilyPond in the text.  The reader knows what the
manual is about.

* If you do, capitalization is LilyPond.

* Do not explicitly refer to the reader/user.  There is no one else
besides the reader and the writer.

* Do not use abbreviations (don't, won't, etc.).

* Avoid fluff (``Notice that,'' ``as you can see,'' ``Currently,'') 

* Avoid long stretches of input code.  Noone is going to read them in
print.  Instead refer to an example input file (@inputfileref), these
are clickable in HTML.

* Abbrevs in caps, e.g. HTML, DVI, MIDI, etc.

* Colon usage
  0. Do not use a colon to introduce examples, sentences just continue

      in the display material.

  1. To introduce lists
  2. When beginning a quote: "So, he said,..."
     This usage is rarer.  Americans often just use a comma.
  3. When adding a defining example at the end of a sentence.
