@section Fixing overlapping notation

This may come as a surprise, but LilyPond isn't perfect.  Some notation
elements can overlap.  This is unfortunate, but (in most cases) is easily
solved.

@lilypond[quote,fragment,ragged-right,verbatim,relative=2]
e4^\markup{ \italic ritenuto } g b e
@end lilypond

@cindex padding

The easiest solution is to increase the distance between the object
(in this case text, but it could easily be fingerings or dynamics
instead) and the note.  In LilyPond, this is called the
@code{padding} property; it is measured in staff spaces.  For most
objects, this value is around 1.0 or less (it varies with each
object). We want to increase it, so let's try 1.5

@lilypond[quote,fragment,ragged-right,verbatim,relative=2]
\once \override TextScript #'padding = #1.5
e4^\markup{ \italic ritenuto } g b e
@end lilypond

That looks better, but it isn't quite big enough.  After experimenting
with a few values, we think 2.3 is the best number in this case.  However,
this number is merely the result of experimentation and my personal
taste in notation.  Try the above example with 2.3... but also try higher
(and lower) numbers.  Which do you think looks the best?

@cindex extra-offset

Another solution gives us complete control over placing the object -- we
can move it horizontally or vertically.  This is done with the
@code{extra-offset} property.  It is slightly more complicated and can
cause other problems.  When we move objects with @code{extra-offset},
the movement is done after LilyPond has placed all other objects.  This means
that the result can overlap with other objects.

@lilypond[quote,fragment,ragged-right,verbatim,relative=2]
\once \override TextScript #'extra-offset = #'( 1.0 . -1.0 )
e4^\markup{ \italic ritenuto } g b e
@end lilypond

With @code{extra-offset}, the first number controls the horizontal
movement (left is negative); the second number controls the vertical
movement (up is positive).  After a bit of experimenting, we decided
that these values look good

@lilypond[quote,fragment,ragged-right,verbatim,relative=2]
\once \override TextScript #'extra-offset = #'( -1.6 . 1.0 )
e4^\markup{ \italic ritenuto } g b e
@end lilypond

@noindent
Again, these numbers are simply the result of a few experiments and
looking at the output.  You might prefer the text to be slightly higher,
or to the left, or whatever.  Try it and look at the result!
