DOC ORGANIZATION

There are three parts to the documentation: the Learning Manual,
the Notation Reference, and the Technical Details.

* Long, wordy, chatty explanations go in the Learning Manual.
This is aimed at users learning something for the first
time -- not necessarily just learning lilypond notation, but
also things like learning how to deal with projects, tweaking,
preparing parts for orchestras, etc.  Less formal language
may be used here.

* Notation Reference is a (hopefully complete) description of
LilyPond input notation.  Some material from here may be
duplicated in the Learning Manual (for teaching).  The
material is presented in an approximate order of increasing
difficulty, but the goal is _not_ to provide a step-by-step
learning environment.  For example, all material under
"Notes" should remain in that section, even though microtonal
accidentals may seem more advanced than info about clefs or
time signatures -- "Notes" should be a one-stop reference
about, well, notes.  This section is written in formal
technical writing style.

* Technical Details contains information about using
the program lilypond with other programs (lilypond-book,
operating systems, GUIs, convert-ly, etc).  This section
is writtin in formal technical writing style.

GENERAL GUIDELINES

* Do not forget to create @cindex entries for new sections of text.
  Enter commands with @funindex, i.e.
  @funindex \relative
  do not bother with the @code{} (they are added automatically).  These
  items are added to both the command index and the unified index.

* The use of the word `illegal' is inappropriate in most cases.  Say
  `invalid' instead.

* Avoid long stretches of input code.  Noone is going to read them in
  print.  Instead refer to an example input file (@inputfileref), these
  are clickable in HTML.

* Abbrevs in caps, e.g., HTML, DVI, MIDI, etc.

* Colon usage

  0. Do not use a colon to introduce examples, sentences just continue

      in the display material.

  1. To introduce lists
  2. When beginning a quote: "So, he said,..."
     This usage is rarer.  Americans often just use a comma.
  3. When adding a defining example at the end of a sentence.

* To produce good looking texinfo output (for both TTY and DVI) some
  additional formatting rules should be followed.

  . Do not use tabs.  They expand to nothing in DVI output.

  . Do not use spaces at the beginning of a line (except in @example
    or @verbatim environments), and do not use more than a single space
    between words.  `makeinfo' copies the input lines verbatim without
    removing those spaces.

  . Use two spaces after a priod.

  . Variables or numbers which consist of a single character (probably
    followed by a punctuation mark) should be tied properly, either to
    the previous or the next word.  Example:

      The variable@tie{}@var{a} ...

  . To get consistent indentation in the DVI output it is better to avoid
    the @verbatim environment.  Use the @example environment instead if
    possible, but without extraneous indentation.  For example, this

      @example
        foo {
          bar
        }
      @end example

    should be replaced with

      @example
      foo {
        bar
      }
      @end example

    where `@example' starts the line (without leading spaces).

  . Use the `quote' option in @lilypond commands if possible.

  . Do not compress the input vertically; this is, do not use

      Beginning of logical unit
      @example
      ...
      @end example
      continuation of logical unit

    but

      Beginning of logical unit

      @example
      ...
      @end example

      @noindent
      continuation of logical unit

    This makes it easier to not forget `@noindent'.

  . Non-ASCII characters which are in utf-8 should be directly used;
    this is, don't say `Ba@ss{}tuba' but `Ba√ütuba'.  This ensures that
    all such characters appear in all output formats.

* Lines should be less than 80 characters long.

* Use @q instead of `...' and @qq instead of ``...''.  The latter macro
  should be used with care since we use `...' as the default quoting
  throughout the manual, except for things related to direct speech.

HINTS FOR TECHNICAL WRITING STYLE

* Do not refer to LilyPond in the text.  The reader knows what the
  manual is about.  If you do, capitalization is LilyPond.

* If you explicitly refer to `lilypond', the program (or any other
  command to be executed), say `@command{lilypond}'.

* Do not explicitly refer to the reader/user.  There is no one else
  besides the reader and the writer.

* Do not use abbreviations (don't, won't, etc.).  If you do, use a
  comma after it:

    blabla blabla, i.e., blabla blabla

* Avoid fluff (``Notice that,'' ``as you can see,'' ``Currently,'').
