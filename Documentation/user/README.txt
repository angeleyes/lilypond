Info for Documentation
----------------------

%%%%% BOOKS

There are four parts to the documentation: the Learning Manual,
the Notation Reference, the Program Reference, and the Music
Glossary.

* Learning Manual: long, chatty, friendly explanations go here.
  This is aimed at users learning something for the first time --
  not necessarily just learning lilypond notation, but also things
  like learning how to deal with projects, tweaking, preparing parts
  for orchestras, etc.  Less formal language may be used here.

Users are encouraged to read the complete Learning Manual from
start-to-finish.


* Notation Reference: a (hopefully complete) description of
  LilyPond input notation.  Some material from here may be
  duplicated in the Learning Manual (for teaching).  The material is
  presented in an approximate order of increasing difficulty, but
  the goal is _not_ to provide a step-by-step learning environment.
  For example, all material under "Pitches" should remain in that
  section, even though microtonal accidentals may seem more advanced
  than info about clefs or time signatures -- "Pitches" should be a
  one-stop reference about the pitch portion of notes.  This section
  is written in formal technical writing style.

Users are not expected to read this manual from start to finish.
However, they should be familiar with the material in the Learning
Manual (particularly ``Fundamental Concepts''), so do not repeat
that material in this book.  Also, you should assume that users
know what the notation means; explaining musical concepts happens
in the Music Glossary.


* Program Usage: information about using the program lilypond with
  other programs (lilypond-book, operating systems, GUIs,
  convert-ly, etc).  This section is written in formal technical
  writing style.

Users are not expected to read this manual from start to finish.


* Music Glossary: information about the music notation itself.
  Explainations and translations about notation terms go here.

Users are not expected to read this manual from start to finish.


%%%%% SECTION ORGANIZATION

The order of headings inside documentation sections should be:

main docs
@commonprop
@seealso
@refbugs

* You must include a @seealso with at least one link to @lsrdir{}.

* @commonprop and @refbugs are optional.


%%%%% LILYPOND FORMATTING

* Use two spaces for indentation in lilypond examples.  (no tabs)

* If possible, only write one bar per line.  The notes on each
  line should be an independent line.
  Bad:
    \override textscript #'padding = #3 c1^"hi"
  Good:
    \override textscript #'padding = #3
    c1^"hi"

* LilyPond input should be produce via
    @lilypond[verbatim,quote,ragged-right]
  with `fragment' and `relative=2' optional.

  Examples about page layout may alter the quote/ragged-right
  options.  Omitting `verbatim' is not allowed.

* Inspirational headwords are produced with
  @lilypondfile[ragged-right,line-width=16\cm,staffsize=16,quote]
  {pitches-headword.ly}

* Avoid long stretches of input code.  Noone is going to read them
  in print.  Instead refer to an example input file with @lsr{}.


%%%%% TEXT FORMATTING

* Lines should be less than 72 characters long.  (I personally
  recommend writing with 66-char lines, but don't bother modifying
  existing material.)

* Do not use tabs.  They expand to nothing in DVI output.

* Do not use spaces at the beginning of a line (except in @example
  or @verbatim environments), and do not use more than a single
  space between words.  `makeinfo' copies the input lines verbatim
  without removing those spaces.

* Use two spaces after a period.

* Variables or numbers which consist of a single character
  (probably followed by a punctuation mark) should be tied
  properly, either to the previous or the next word.  Example:

      The variable@tie{}@var{a} ...

* To get consistent indentation in the DVI output it is better to
  avoid the @verbatim environment.  Use the @example environment
  instead if possible, but without extraneous indentation.  For
  example, this

    @example
      foo {
        bar
      }
    @end example

  should be replaced with

    @example
    foo {
      bar
    }
    @end example

  where `@example' starts the line (without leading spaces).

* Do not compress the input vertically; this is, do not use

    Beginning of logical unit
    @example
    ...
    @end example
    continuation of logical unit

  but

    Beginning of logical unit

    @example
    ...
    @end example

    @noindent
    continuation of logical unit

  This makes it easier to avoid forgetting the `@noindent'.

* in @itemize use @item on a separate line like this:
  @itemize
  @item
  Foo

  @item
  Bar

  Do not use @itemize @bullet.

* Use @q instead of `...' and @qq instead of ``...''.  The latter macro
  should be used with care since we use `...' as the default quoting
  throughout the manual, except for things related to direct speech.

  In most cases, you should use @code{} or @samp{} instead.


%%%%% READABILITY

* Non-ASCII characters which are in utf-8 should be directly used;
  this is, don't say `Ba@ss{}tuba' but `Ba√ütuba'.  This ensures that
  all such characters appear in all output formats.

* Don't use a @ref{link to another section} in the middle of a
  sentence.  It looks ok in HTML, moderately bad in PDF, and
  utterly horrible in INFO.  Instead, reword the sentence so that
  users are encouraged to see @ref{link to another section}.
  (at the end of the sentence)

* Do not forget to create @cindex entries for new sections of text.
  Enter commands with @funindex, i.e.
    @cindex pitches, writing in different octaves
    @funindex \relative
  do not bother with the @code{} (they are added automatically).  These
  items are added to both the command index and the unified index.

* Abbrevs in caps, e.g., HTML, DVI, MIDI, etc.

* Colon usage

  1. To introduce lists
  2. When beginning a quote: "So, he said,..."
     This usage is rarer.  Americans often just use a comma.
  3. When adding a defining example at the end of a sentence.


%%%%% TECHNICAL WRITING STYLE

* Do not refer to LilyPond in the text.  The reader knows what the
  manual is about.  If you do, capitalization is LilyPond.

* If you explicitly refer to `lilypond' the program (or any other
  command to be executed), say `@command{lilypond}'.

* Do not explicitly refer to the reader/user.  There is no one
  else besides the reader and the writer.

* Do not use abbreviations (don't, won't, etc.).  If you do, use a
  comma after it:

    blabla blabla, i.e., blabla blabla

* Avoid fluff (``Notice that,'' ``as you can see,''
  ``Currently,'').

* The use of the word `illegal' is inappropriate in most cases.
  Say `invalid' instead.


%%%%% UPDATING DOCS
convert-ly -e --from=... --to=... --no-version *.itely

% to find the current version number,
grep "version \"" tutorial.itely

%  (nobody ever remembers to update this file, so I've stopped
%  trying to record it here)
