There are two sets of releases for LilyPond: stable releases, and
unstable development releases.  Stable versions have an even-numbered
@q{minor} version number (i.e. 2.8, 2.10, 2.12, etc).  Development
versions have an odd-numbered @q{minor} version number (i.e. 2.7, 2.9,
2.11, etc).

Building LilyPond is a very involved process, so we @strong{highly}
recommend using the precompiled binaries.

If you have MacOS 10.3 or 10.4 and you would like to use Python
scripts such as @command{convert-ly} and @command{lilypond-book}, see
@ref{Setup for MacOS X,,,lilypond-program,Application Usage}.

@ignore
You can also compile LilyPond directly from the source code. This
requires that you can read English, so this section is not
translated.  If you really want to compile LilyPond, see
@iftex
@c DO NOT translate the following line at all.
@ref{Compiling from source,,,lilypond-program,Application Usage}.
@end iftex
@ifhtml
@c Please translate the following line (but not the .html file name)
the @uref{Compiling-from-source.html,documentation in English}.
@end ifhtml
@end ignore

@c TRANSLATORS:
@c   Please **do not** translate the file included below.  Users
@c   should not be compiling LilyPond themselves; if they really
@c   want to do so, they should be able to read the English docs,
@c   because they'll probably need to ask questions in English
@c   on the -devel list.   -gp
@c Instead, please uncomment and translate the paragraph above,
@c and remove all stuff (menu, nodes, contents) below this line.
