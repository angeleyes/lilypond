[TODO:

* different name. Ports sucks

* drop for 1.4

* mutopia is rather offtopic in the lilypond manual

Mutopia is a collection of public domain sheet music.  All the music
on Mutopia is completely free to download, print out, perform and
distribute.  Mutopia is similar in spirit to Project Gutenburg.  You can
help the project by entering music (either by hand, or by converting
from scans or MIDI) and submitting it.  Point your browser to the
@uref{http://www.mutopiaproject.org}.

The ports collection to makes all music in Mutopia very easily
accessible for LilyPond users to study, edit and print.  The
ports-system performs the following functions:

@enumerate 1
@item  download anything from Mutopia
@item  compile for printing or for Mutopia submission
@item  publish and package for Mutopia
@end enumerate

Type @samp{make help} in @file{ports} directory to see possible
targets.

@ignore
[TODO]

Now that we have the @samp{make sync} target, maybe we should
only dist the composers in the tarball:
@example
ports/mutopia/ArbeauT
ports/mutopia/BachJS
ports/mutopia/BanchieriA
ports/mutopia/BeethovenLv
ports/mutopia/BendaJA
ports/mutopia/BruhnsN
ports/mutopia/CarcassiM
ports/mutopia/CarulliF
ports/mutopia/ClementiM
ports/mutopia/DowlandJ
ports/mutopia/GiordianoG
ports/mutopia/JoplinS
ports/mutopia/MilanL
ports/mutopia/MozartWA
ports/mutopia/PaganiniN
ports/mutopia/Saint-SaensC
ports/mutopia/SatieE
ports/mutopia/SchubertF
@end example

To build the Solo Cello Suite from J.S.Bach, you would do:
@example
$ cd ports/mutopia/BachJS
$ make sync
$ cd BWV1008/solo-cello-suite-ii
$ make mutopia
@end example

Disadvantage: no clue of available titles.
@end ignore
