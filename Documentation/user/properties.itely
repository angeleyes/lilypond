@node Properties, , , Reference Manual

Properties are Scheme values. Most of them are in the generated documentation, but some MIDI properties are not. Here is their documentation

@macro propertytype{t}
 (\t\)
@end macro


@table @samp
  @item @code{midiInstrument}@indexcode{midiInstrument} @propertytype{string}
    Sets the instrument for MIDI output.  If this property is not set
    then LilyPond will use the @code{instrument} property.  This must
    be set to one of the strings on the list of MIDI instruments that
    appears in section @ref{midilist}.  If you use a string which
    is not listed, LilyPond will silently substitute piano.

  @item @code{transposing}@indexcode{transposing} @propertytype{integer}
    Transpose the MIDI output.  Set this property to the number of
    half-steps to transpose by.

@end table
