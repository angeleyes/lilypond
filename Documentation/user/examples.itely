@node Single staff
@section Single staff
@subsection Notes only

The first example gives you a staff with notes, suitable for a solo
instrument or a melodic fragment.  Cut and paste this into a file,
add notes, and you're finished!

@lilypond[verbatim,raggedright]

melody = \relative c' {
\clef treble
\key c \major
\time 4/4

  a4 b c d
}

\score{
  \new Staff \melody
  \paper { }
  \midi { \tempo 4=60 }
}

@end lilypond

@subsection Notes and lyrics

The next example demonstrates a simple melody with lyrics.  Cut and
paste, add notes, then words for the lyrics.  This example turns off
automatic beaming, which is common for vocal parts.  If you want to use
automatic beaming, you'll have to change or comment out the relevant
line.

@lilypond[verbatim,raggedright]

melody = \relative c' {
\clef treble
\key c \major
\time 4/4

  a4 b c d
}

text = \lyrics {
  Aaa Bee Cee Dee
}

\score{
  <<
    \context Voice = one {
      \autoBeamOff
      \melody
      }
    \lyricsto "one" \new Lyrics \text
  >>
  \paper { }
  \midi { \tempo 4=60 }
}

@subsection Notes and chords

Want to prepare a lead sheet with a melody and chords?  Look no farther!

@lilypond[verbatim,raggedright]

melody =  \relative c' {
\clef treble
\key c \major
\time 4/4

  f4 e8[ c] d4 g |
  a2 ~ a2 |
}

harmonies = \chords {
  c4:m f:min7 g:maj c:aug d2:dim b:sus
}

\score {
   <<
    \context ChordNames {
        \set chordChanges = ##t
        \harmonies
    }
    \context Staff = one \melody
  >>

  \paper{ }
  \midi  { \tempo 4=60}
}

@subsection Notes, lyrics, and chords.

This template allows you to prepare a song with melody, words, and chords.

@lilypond[verbatim,raggedright]

    \context ChordNames {
        \set chordChanges = ##t
        \harmonies
    }
    \context Voice = one {
	\autoBeamOff
        \melody
    }
    \lyricsto "one" \new Lyrics \text
