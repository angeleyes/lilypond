@node Preface to version 1.8
@unnumberedsec Preface to version 1.8

During the past year when we worked on 1.8, the focus has not so much
been on adding shiny new features, or more excellent
typography. Instead, we have taken stock of how various things worked
on the inside. In many cases, we found new and more elegant ways to
implement these systems, making them more robust and more flexible.

If you are familiar with LilyPond version 1.6, then version 1.8 will
no offer no big surprises. The only real change from 1.6 to 1.8 is the
way that formatted text is entered. There is now a new syntax that is
more friendly, more versatile and extensible. We hope you like it.

Less visible changes include rewritten chord name formatting and entry
code, revised music expression storage, and tighter integration
between lilypond variables and Scheme variables.

Special thanks for version 1.8 go out to Juergen Reuter for lots of
work on the ancient notation engine, and to Amy Zapf for pushing us to
rewrite the chord name support

@unnumberedsec Preface to version 1.6

It must have been during a rehearsal of the EJE (Eindhoven Youth
Orchestra), somewhere in 1995 that Jan, one of the cranked violists
told Han-Wen, one of the distorted French horn players, about the
grand new project he was working on.  It was an automated system for
printing music (to be precise, it was MPP, a preprocessor for
MusiXTeX).  As it happened, Han-Wen accidentally wanted to print out
some parts from a score, so he started looking at the software, and he
quickly got hooked.  It was decided that MPP was a dead end. After
lots of philosophizing and heated e-mail exchanges Han-Wen started
LilyPond in 1996.  This time, Jan got sucked into Han-Wen's new
project.

In some ways, developing a computer program is like learning to play
an instrument. In the beginning, discovering how it works is fun, and
the things you cannot do are challenging. After the initial excitement,
you have to practice and practice. Scales and studies can be dull, and
if you are not motivated by others---teachers, conductors or
audience---it is very tempting to give up. You continue, and gradually
playing becomes a part of your life. Some days it comes naturally, and
it is wonderful, and on some days it just does not work, but you keep
playing, day after day.

Like making music, working on LilyPond is can be dull work, and on
some days it feels like plodding through a morass of
bugs. Nevertheless, it has become a part of our life, and we keep
doing it. Probably the most important motivation is that our program
actually does something useful for people. When we browse around the
net we find many people that use LilyPond, and produce impressive
pieces of sheet music.  Seeing that still feels unreal, but in a very
pleasant way.

Our users not only give us good vibes by using our program, many of
them also help us by giving suggestions and sending bugreports. So
first and foremost, we would like to thank all users that sent us
bugreports, gave suggestions or contributed in any other way to
LilyPond.

We would also like to thank the following people: Mats Bengtsson for
the incountable number of questions he answered on the mailing list,
and Rune Zedeler for his energy in finding and fixing bugs.  Nicola
Bernardini for inviting us to his workshop on music publishing, which
was truly a masterclass, and Heinz Stolba and James Ingram for
teaching us there. 

Playing and printing music is more than nice analogy. Programming
together is a lot of fun, and helping people is deeply satisfying, but
ultimately, working on LilyPond is a way to express our deep love for
music. May it help you create lots of beautiful music!
