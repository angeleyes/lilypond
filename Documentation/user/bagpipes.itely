@subsubsection Bagpipe definitions

LilyPond contains special definitions for music for the Scottish
highland bagpipe; to use them, add

@example
\include "bagpipe.ly"
@end example

@noindent
at the top of your input file.  This lets you add the special grace notes
common to bagpipe music with short commands.  For example, you could
write @code{\taor} instead of

@example
\grace @{ \small G32[ d G e] @}
@end example

@code{bagpipe.ly} also contains pitch definitions for the bagpipe
notes in the appropriate octaves, so you do not need to worry about
@code{\relative} or @code{\transpose}.

@lilypond[ragged-right,verbatim,quote,notime]
\include "bagpipe.ly"
{ \grg G4 \grg a \grg b \grg c \grg d \grg e \grg f \grA g A }
@end lilypond

Bagpipe music nominally uses the key of D Major (even though that
isn't really true).  However, since that is the only key that can be used,
the key signature is normally not written out.  To set this up correctly,
always start your music with @code{\hideKeySignature}.  If you for some
reason want to show the key signature, you can use @code{\showKeySignature}
instead.

Some modern music use cross fingering on c and f to flatten those notes.
This can be indicated by @code{cflat} or @code{fflat}.  Similarly, the
piobaireachd high g can be written @code{gflat} when it occurs in light
music.

@subsubsection Bagpipe example

This is what the well known tune Amazing Grace looks like in bagpipe
notation.

@lilypond[verbatim,quote]
\include "bagpipe.ly"
\layout {
  indent = 0.0\cm
  \context { \Score \remove "Bar_number_engraver" }
}

\header {
  title = "Amazing Grace"
  meter = "Hymn"
  arranger = "Trad. arr."
}
