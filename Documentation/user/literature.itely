@item Stone80

Kurt Stone, Music Notation in the Twentieth Century
Norton, New York 1980.

The most important book on notation in recent years: it describes music
notation for modern serious music, but starts out with a thorough
overview of existing traditional notation practices.

@item read-notation,
Gardner Read,  Music Notation: a Manual of Modern Practice.
Taplinger Publishing, New York (2nd edition).

This is as close to the ``standard'' reference work for music notation
issues as one is likely to get.

@item hader48,

Karl Hader, Aus der Werkstatt eines Notenstechers. Waldheim--Eberle
Verlag, Vienna 1948.

Hader was the chief-engraver of the Waldheim-Eberle music publishers.
This beautiful booklet was intended as an introduction for laymen on the
art of engraving.  It contains a step by step, in-depth explanation of
how to cut and stamp music into zinc plates.  It also contains a few
compactly formulated rules on musical orthography. This book is out of
print.


@item ross,
Ted Ross, Teach yourself the art of music engraving and processing.
Hansen House, Miami, Florida 	 1987

This book is about engraving, i.e.  professional typesetting.  It contains
directions on good typesetting, but the sections on reproduction
technicalities, how to use pens and history are interesting.

EDV-gesteuerten Notensatz.  Schott-Verlag, Mainz 1988.  ISBN
3-7957-2886-x
