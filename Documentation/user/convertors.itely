@section midi2ly

Midi2ly translates a MIDI input file to a LilyPond source file.
Midi2ly is part of the GNU LilyPond music typesetting package.


Human players usually are rhythmically not very exact when they record
MIDI files.  midi2ly tries to compensate for these errors, but is not
very good at this. It is therefore not recommended to use midi2ly for
human-generated midi files. Correcting the quantization mistakes of the
human player takes a lot of time.

Hackers who know about signal processing are invited to write  a more
robust midi2ly.

@subsection Invoking midi2ly

@example
        midi2ly [options] midi-file
@end example

@unnumberedsec Options

@table @code
@item -b, --no-quantify,
    Write exact durations, e.g.: `a4*385/384'.
@item -D, --debug,
    Print lots of debugging stuff.
@item -h, --help,
    Show a summary of usage.
@item -I, --include=@file{DIR},
    Add DIR to search path.
@item -k, --key=ACC[:MINOR],
    Set default key.  ACC > 0 sets number of sharps; ACC < 0 sets number 
    of flats.  A minor key is indicated by ":1".
@item -n, --no-silly,
    Assume no plets or double dots, assume smallest (reciprocal) duration 16.
@item -o, --output=@file{FILE},
    Set @file{FILE} as default output.
@item -p, --no-plets,
    Assume no plets.
@item -q, --quiet,
    Be quiet.
@item -s, --smallest=N,
    Assume no shorter (reciprocal) durations than N.
@item -v, --verbose,
    Be verbose.
@item -w, --warranty,
    Show the warranty with which midi2ly comes. (It comes with @strong{NO WARRANTY}!)
@item -x, --no-double-dots,
    Assume no double dotted notes.
@end table


@section etf2ly

@subsection Invoking etf2ly
Usage:



@example
        etf2ly [OPTION]... ETF-FILE
@end example

Convert ETF to LilyPond.

Options:
@table @code
@item   -h,--help
this help
@item  -o,--output=FILE
set output filename to FILE
@item  -v,--version
version information
@end table

Enigma Transport Format is a format used by Coda Music Technology's
Finale product. This program will convert part of an ETF file to a
ready-to-use lilypond file.
