@section Polyphony

Polyphony in music refers to having more than one voice occurring in
a piece of music.  Polyphony in LilyPond refers to having more than
one voice on the same staff.

@anchor{Chords}
@unnumberedsubsubsec Chords

@cindex Chords

A chord is formed by a enclosing a set of pitches between @code{<}
and @code{>}.  A chord may be followed by a duration, and a set of
articulations, just like simple notes

@lilypond[verbatim,ragged-right,fragment,quote,relative=1]
<c e g>4 <c>8
@end lilypond

For more information about chords, see @ref{Chord names}.


@c  I don't like having this here, but I can't think of
@c  anywhere else to put it.  :(   -gp
@anchor{Stems}
@unnumberedsubsubsec Stems

Whenever a note is found, a @internalsref{Stem} object is created
automatically.  For whole notes and rests, they are also created but
made invisible.

@refcommands

@funindex \stemUp
@code{\stemUp},
@funindex \stemDown
@code{\stemDown},
@funindex \stemNeutral
@code{\stemNeutral}.


@commonprop

To change the direction of stems in the middle of the staff, use

@lilypond[quote,ragged-right,fragment,relative=2,verbatim]
a4 b c b
\override Stem #'neutral-direction = #up
a4 b c b
\override Stem #'neutral-direction = #down
a4 b c b
@end lilypond


@anchor{Basic polyphony}
@unnumberedsubsubsec Basic polyphony

@cindex polyphony

The easiest way to enter fragments with more than one voice on a staff
is to enter each voice as a sequence (with @code{@{...@}}), and combine
them simultaneously, separating the voices with @code{\\}

@funindex \\

@lilypond[quote,verbatim,fragment]
\new Staff \relative c' {
  c16 d e f
  <<
    { g4 f e | d2 e2 } \\
    { r8 e4 d c8 ~ | c b16 a b8 g ~ g2 } \\
    { s2. | s4 b4 c2 }
  >>
}
@end lilypond

The separator causes @internalsref{Voice} contexts@footnote{Polyphonic
voices are sometimes called @q{layers} in other notation packages}
@cindex layers
to be instantiated.  They bear the names @code{"1"}, @code{"2"}, etc.  In
each of these contexts, vertical direction of slurs, stems, etc., is set
appropriately.

These voices are all separate from the voice that contains the notes just
outside the @code{<< \\ >>} construct.  This should be noted when making
changes at the voice level.  This also means that slurs and ties cannot go
into or out of a @code{<< \\ >>} construct.  Conversely, parallel voices
from separate @code{<< \\ >>} constructs on the same staff are the
same voice.  Here is the same example, with different noteheads and
colors for each
voice.  Note that the change to the note-head style in the main voice does
not affect
the inside of the @code{<< \\ >>} constructs.  Also, the change to the
second
voice in the first @code{<< \\ >>} construct is effective in the second
@code{<< \\ >>}, and the voice is tied across the two constructs.

@cindex note heads, styles

@lilypond[quote,verbatim,fragment]
\new Staff \relative c' {
  \override NoteHead #'style = #'cross
  \override NoteHead #'color = #red
  c16 d e f
  <<
    { g4 f e } \\
    { \override NoteHead #'style = #'triangle
      \override NoteHead #'color = #blue
    r8 e4 d c8 ~ }
  >> |
  <<
    { d2 e2 } \\
    { c8 b16 a b8 g ~ g2 } \\
    { \override NoteHead #'style = #'slash 
      \override NoteHead #'color = #green
      s4 b4 c2 }
  >>
}
@end lilypond

Polyphony does not change the relationship of notes within a
@code{\relative @{ @}} block.  Each note is calculated relative
to the note immediately preceding it.

@example
\relative @{ noteA << noteB \\ noteC >> noteD @}
@end example

@code{noteC} is relative to @code{noteB}, not @code{noteA};
@code{noteD} is relative to @code{noteC}, not @code{noteB} or
@code{noteA}.


@anchor{Explicitly instantiating voices}
@unnumberedsubsubsec Explicitly instantiating voices

@internalsref{Voice} contexts can also be instantiated manually
inside a @code{<< >>} block to create polyphonic music, using
@code{\voiceOne}, up to @code{\voiceFour} to assign stem directions
and a horizontal shift for each part.

Specifically,
@example
<< \upper \\ \lower >>
@end example

@noindent
is equivalent to

@example
<<
  \new Voice = "1" @{ \voiceOne \upper @}
  \new Voice = "2" @{ \voiceTwo \lower @}
>>
@end example

The @code{\voiceXXX} commands set the direction of stems, slurs, ties,
articulations, text annotations, augmentation dots of dotted
notes, and fingerings.  @code{\voiceOne} and @code{\voiceThree} make
these objects point upwards, while @code{\voiceTwo} and @code{\voiceFour}
make them point downwards.
The command @code{\oneVoice} will revert back to the normal setting.

An expression that appears directly inside a @code{<< >>} belongs to
the main voice.  This is useful when extra voices appear while the main
voice is playing.  Here is a more correct rendition of the example from
the previous section.  The crossed colored noteheads demonstrate that the main
melody is now in a single voice context.

@lilypond[quote,ragged-right,verbatim]
\new Staff \relative c' {
  \override NoteHead #'style = #'cross
  \override NoteHead #'color = #red
  c16 d e f
  \voiceOne
  <<
    { g4 f e | d2 e2 }
    \new Voice="1" { \voiceTwo
      r8 e4 d c8 ~ | c8 b16 a b8 g ~ g2
      \oneVoice
    }
    \new Voice { \voiceThree
      s2. | s4 b4 c2
      \oneVoice
    }
  >>
  \oneVoice
}
@end lilypond

The correct definition of the voices allows the melody to be slurred.
@lilypond[quote,ragged-right,verbatim]
\new Staff \relative c' {
  c16^( d e f
  \voiceOne
  <<
    { g4 f e | d2 e2) }
    \context Voice="1" { \voiceTwo
      r8 e4 d c8 ~ | c8 b16 a b8 g ~ g2
      \oneVoice
    }
    \new Voice { \voiceThree
      s2. s4 b4 c2
      \oneVoice
    }
  >>
  \oneVoice
}
@end lilypond

Avoiding the @code{\\} separator also allows nesting polyphony
constructs, which in some case might be a more natural way to typeset
the music.

@lilypond[quote,ragged-right,verbatim]
\new Staff \relative c' {
  c16^( d e f
  \voiceOne
  <<
    { g4 f e | d2 e2) }
    \context Voice="1" { \voiceTwo
      r8 e4 d c8 ~ |
      <<
        {c8 b16 a b8 g ~ g2}
        \new Voice { \voiceThree
          s4 b4 c2
          \oneVoice
        }
      >>
    \oneVoice
    }
  >>
  \oneVoice
}
@end lilypond

In some instances of complex polyphonic music, you may need additional
voices to avoid collisions between notes.  Additional voices are added
by defining an identifier, as shown below:

@lilypond[quote,verbatim,ragged-right,relative=2]
voiceFive = #(context-spec-music (make-voice-props-set 4) 'Voice)

\relative c''' <<
  { \voiceOne g4 ~  \stemDown g32[ f( es d c b a b64 )g] } \\
  { \voiceThree  b4} \\
  { \voiceFive d,} \\
  { \voiceTwo g,}
>>
@end lilypond


@anchor{Collision Resolution}
@unnumberedsubsubsec Collision Resolution

Normally, note heads with a different number of dots are not merged, but
when the object property @code{merge-differently-dotted} is set in
the @internalsref{NoteCollision} object, they are merged:

@lilypond[quote,verbatim,fragment,ragged-right,relative=2]
\new Voice << {
  g8 g8
  \override Staff.NoteCollision
    #'merge-differently-dotted = ##t
  g8 g8
} \\ { g8.[ f16] g8.[ f16] } >>
@end lilypond

Similarly, you can merge half note heads with eighth notes, by setting
@code{merge-differently-headed}:

@lilypond[quote,ragged-right,fragment,relative=2,verbatim]
\new Voice << {
  c8 c4.
  \override Staff.NoteCollision
    #'merge-differently-headed = ##t
c8 c4. } \\ { c2 c2 } >>
@end lilypond

@noindent
@code{merge-differently-headed} and @code{merge-differently-dotted}
only apply to opposing stem directions (ie. Voice 1 & 2).

LilyPond also vertically shifts rests that are opposite of a stem,
for example

@lilypond[quote,ragged-right,fragment,verbatim]
\new Voice << c''4 \\ r4 >>
@end lilypond

If three or more notes line up in the same column,
@code{merge-differently-headed} cannot
successfully complete the merge of the two notes that should be merged.
To allow the merge to work properly, apply a @code{\shift} to the note that
should not be merged.  In the first measure of following example,
@code{merge-differently-headed} does not work (the half-note head is
solid).  In the second measure, @code{\shiftOn} is applied to move the
top @code{g} out of the column, and @code{merge-differently-headed}
works properly.

@lilypond[quote,ragged-right,fragment,verbatim,relative=2]
\override Staff.NoteCollision #'merge-differently-headed = ##t
<<
  { d=''2 g2 } \\
  { \oneVoice d=''8 c8 r4 e,8 c'8 r4 } \\
  { \voiceFour e,,2 e'2}
>>
<<
  { d'=''2 \shiftOn g2 } \\ 
  { \oneVoice d=''8 c8 r4 e,8 c'8 r4 } \\
  { \voiceFour e,,2 e'2}
>>
@end lilypond

further shift levels.

When LilyPond cannot cope, the @code{force-hshift}
property of the @internalsref{NoteColumn} object and pitched rests can
be used to override typesetting decisions.

@lilypond[quote,verbatim,ragged-right]

Program reference: the objects responsible for resolving collisions are
@internalsref{NoteCollision} and @internalsref{RestCollision}.


@refbugs

When using @code{merge-differently-headed} with an upstem eighth or a
shorter note, and a downstem half note, the eighth note gets the wrong
offset.

There is no support for clusters where the same note occurs with
different accidentals in the same chord.  In this case, it is
recommended to use enharmonic transcription, or to use special cluster
notation (see @ref{Clusters}).

@cindex adjusting staff symbol

Notes, dynamic signs, etc., are grouped
with a set of horizontal lines, called a staff (plural @q{staves}).  In
LilyPond, these lines are drawn using a separate layout object called
@code{staff symbol}.

The staff symbol may be tuned in the number, thickness and distance
of lines, using properties.  This is demonstrated in the example files
@lsr{staff,changing-the-number-of-lines-in-a-staff.ly} and
@lsr{staff,changing-the-staff-size.ly}.

In addition, staves may be started and stopped at will. This is done
with @code{\startStaff} and @code{\stopStaff}.

@lilypond[verbatim,relative=2,fragment]

@anchor{Ties}
@unnumberedsubsubsec Ties

@cindex tie
@funindex ~

A tie connects two adjacent note heads of the same pitch.  The tie in
effect extends the length of a note.  Ties should not be confused with
slurs, which indicate articulation, or phrasing slurs, which indicate
musical phrasing.  A tie is entered using the tilde symbol @samp{~}

@lilypond[quote,ragged-right,fragment,verbatim]
e' ~ e' <c' e' g'> ~ <c' e' g'>
@end lilypond

When a tie is applied to a chord, all note heads whose pitches match
are connected.  When no note heads match, no ties will be created.  Chords
may be partially tied by placing the tie inside the chord,

@lilypond[quote,ragged-right,fragment,verbatim,relative=1]
<c~ e g~ b> <c e g b>
@end lilypond

A tie is just a way of extending a note duration, similar to the
augmentation dot.  The following example shows two ways of notating
exactly the same concept

@lilypond[quote,fragment,ragged-right]
\time 3/4 c'2. c'2 ~ c'4
@end lilypond

@noindent
Ties are used either when the note crosses a bar line, or when dots
cannot be used to denote the rhythm.  When using ties, larger note
values should be aligned to subdivisions of the measure, such as

@lilypond[fragment,quote,ragged-right]
\relative {
  r8 c8 ~ c2 r4 | r8^"not" c2 ~ c8 r4
}
@end lilypond

If you need to tie a lot of notes over bars, it may be easier to use
automatic note splitting (see @ref{Automatic note splitting}).  This
mechanism automatically splits long notes, and ties them across bar
lines.

@funindex \repeatTie

When a second alternative of a repeat starts with a tied note, you
have to repeat the tie. This can be achieved with @code{\repeatTie},

@lilypond[fragment,quote,ragged-right,relative=2]
r <c e g>\repeatTie
@end lilypond

@cindex repeating ties
@cindex volta brackets and ties

@commonprop

Ties are sometimes used to write out arpeggios.  In this case, two tied
notes need not be consecutive.  This can be achieved by setting the
@code{tieWaitForNote} property to true. The same feature is also useful,
for example, to tie a tremolo to a chord. For example,

@lilypond[fragment,verbatim,relative=1,ragged-right,quote]
\set tieWaitForNote = ##t
\grace { c16[~ e~ g]~ } <c, e g>2
\repeat tremolo 8 { c32~ c'~ } <c c,>1
e8~ c~ a~ f~ <e' c a f>2
@end lilypond

Ties may be engraved manually by changing the @code{tie-configuration}
property.  The first number indicates the distance from the center
of the staff in staff-spaces, and the second number indicates the
direction (1=up, -1=down).

@lilypond[fragment,verbatim,relative=1,ragged-right,quote]
<c e g>2~ <c e g> |

@refbugs

Switching staves when a tie is active will not produce a slanted tie.

Changing clefs or octavations during a tie is not really
well-defined.  In these cases, a slur may be preferable.


@anchor{Slurs}
@unnumberedsubsubsec Slurs

@cindex Slurs

A slur indicates that notes are to be played bound or
@emph{legato}.  They are entered using parentheses

@lilypond[quote,ragged-right,relative=2,fragment,verbatim]
f( g a) a8 b( a4 g2 f4)
<c e>2( <b d>2)
@end lilypond

The direction of a slur can be specified with
@code{\slur@emph{DIR}}, where @code{@emph{DIR}} is
either @code{Up}, @code{Down}, or @code{Neutral} (automatically
selected).

However, there is a convenient shorthand for forcing slur
directions.  By adding @code{_} or @code{^} before the opening
parentheses, the direction is also set.  For example,

@lilypond[relative=2,ragged-right,quote,verbatim,fragment]
c4_( c) c^( c)
@end lilypond

Only one slur can be printed at once.  If you need to print a long
slur over a few small slurs, please see @ref{Phrasing slurs}.


@commonprop

Some composers write two slurs when they want legato chords.  This can
be achieved in LilyPond by setting @code{doubleSlurs},

@cindex Articulations
@cindex scripts
@cindex ornaments

A variety of symbols can appear above and below notes to indicate
different characteristics of the performance.  They are added to a note
by adding a dash and the character signifying the
articulation.  They are demonstrated here

@lilypondfile[quote,ragged-right]{script-abbreviations.ly}

The meanings of these shorthands can be changed.  See
@file{ly/@/script@/-init@/.ly} for examples.

The script is automatically placed, but the direction can be forced as
well.  Like other pieces of LilyPond code, @code{_} will place them
below the staff, and @code{^} will place them above.

@lilypond[quote,ragged-right,fragment,verbatim]

@end lilypond

Other symbols can be added using the syntax
@var{note}@code{\}@var{name}.  Again, they
can be forced up or down using @code{^} and @code{_},
e.g.,

@lilypondfile[ragged-right,quote]{script-chart.ly}


@commonprop

The vertical ordering of scripts is controlled with the
@code{script-priority} property.  The lower this number, the closer it
will be put to the note.  In this example, the
@internalsref{TextScript} (the sharp symbol) first has the lowest
priority, so it is put lowest in the first example.  In the second, the
prall trill (the @internalsref{Script}) has the lowest, so it is on the
inside.  When two objects have the same priority, the order in which
they are entered decides which one comes first.

@noindent
A hairpin normally starts at the left edge of the beginning note
and ends on the right edge of the ending note.  If the ending
note falls on the downbeat, the hairpin ends on the immediately
preceding barline. This may be modified by setting the
@code{hairpinToBarline} property,

@lilypond[quote,ragged-right,fragment,verbatim,relative=2]
\set hairpinToBarline = ##f
c4\< c2. c4\!
@end lilypond

In some situations the @code{\espressivo} articulation mark may
be suitable to indicate a crescendo and decrescendo on the one note,

@lilypond[quote,ragged-right,fragment,verbatim,relative=2]
c2 b4 a g1\espressivo
@end lilypond

This may give rise to very short hairpins.  Use @code{minimum-length}
in @internalsref{Voice}.@internalsref{Hairpin} to lengthen them, for
example

@example
\override Voice.Hairpin #'minimum-length = #5
@end example

@cindex al niente
@cindex niente, al

Hairpins may be printed with a circled tip (al niente notation) by
setting the @code{circled-tip} property,

@lilypond[quote,ragged-right,fragment,relative=2,verbatim]
\override Hairpin #'circled-tip = ##t
c2\< c\!
c4\> c\< c2\!

@end lilypond

To create new dynamic marks or text that should be aligned
with dynamics, see @ref{New dynamic marks}.

Vertical positioning of dynamics is handled by
@internalsref{DynamicLineSpanner}.


@commonprop

Dynamics that occur at, begin on, or end on, the same note
will be vertically aligned.  If you want to ensure that dynamics
are aligned when they do not occur on the same note, you can
increase the @code{staff-padding} property.

@example
\override DynamicLineSpanner #'staff-padding = #4
@end example

You may also use this property if the dynamics are colliding
with other notation.

Crescendi and decrescendi that end on the first note of a
new line are not printed.  To change this behavior, use

@example
\override Score.Hairpin #'after-line-breaking = ##t
@end example

Text style dynamic changes (such as @emph{cresc.} and @emph{dim.})
are printed with a
dashed line showing their extent.  To surpress printing this line, use

@example
\override DynamicTextSpanner #'dash-period = #-1.0

@cindex repeats

The following types of repetition are supported

@table @code
@item unfold
Repeated music is fully written (played) out.  This is useful when
entering repetitious music.  This is the only kind of repeat that
is included in MIDI output.

@item volta
Repeats are not written out, but alternative endings (volte) are
printed, left to right with brackets.  This is the standard notation
for repeats with alternatives.  These are not played in MIDI output by
default.


@item tremolo
Make tremolo beams.  These are not played in MIDI output by default.

@item percent
Make beat or measure repeats.  These look like percent signs.  These
are not played in MIDI output by default.  Percent repeats must be
declared within a @code{Voice} context.

@end table


@anchor{Repeat syntax}
@unnumberedsubsubsec Repeat syntax

@cindex volta
@cindex prima volta
@cindex seconda volta
@funindex \repeat

LilyPond has one syntactic construct for specifying different types of
repeats.  The syntax is

@example
\repeat @var{variant} @var{repeatcount} @var{repeatbody}
@end example

If you have alternative endings, you may add
@funindex \alternative
@example
\alternative @{
  @var{alternative1}
  @var{alternative2}
  @var{alternative3}
  @dots{}
@}
@end example

@noindent
where each @var{alternative} is a music expression.  If you do not
give enough alternatives for all of the repeats, the first alternative
is assumed to be played more than once.

Standard repeats are used like this

@lilypond[quote,ragged-right,fragment,verbatim,relative=2]
c1
\repeat volta 2 { c4 d e f }
\repeat volta 2 { f e d c }
@end lilypond

With alternative endings

@lilypond[quote,ragged-right,fragment,verbatim,relative=2]
c1
\repeat volta 2 {c4 d e f}
\alternative { {d2 d} {f f,} }
@end lilypond

Repeats with upbeats may be created.

@lilypond[quote,ragged-right,fragment,verbatim,relative=2]
\new Staff {
  \partial 4 e |
  \repeat volta 4 { c2 d2 | e2 f2 | }
  \alternative { { g4 g g e } { a a a a | b2. } }
}
@end lilypond

@noindent
or

@lilypond[quote,ragged-right,fragment,verbatim,relative=2]
\new Staff {
  \partial 4 
  \repeat volta 4 { e | c2 d2 | e2 f2 | }
  \alternative { { \partial 4*3 g4 g g } { a a a a | b2. } }
}
@end lilypond



@funindex \repeatTie

Ties may be added to a second ending,

@lilypond[quote,ragged-right,fragment,verbatim,relative=2]
c1
\repeat volta 2 {c4 d e f ~ }
\alternative { {f2 d} {f\repeatTie f,} }
@end lilypond

It is possible to shorten volta brackets
by setting @code{voltaSpannerDuration}.  In the next example, the
bracket only lasts one measure, which is a duration of 3/4.

@lilypond[verbatim,ragged-right,quote]
\relative c''{
  \time 3/4
  c c c
  \set Score.voltaSpannerDuration = #(ly:make-moment 3 4)
  \repeat volta 5 { d d d }
  \alternative { { e e e f f f }
  { g g g } }
}
@end lilypond

If you want to start a repeat at the beginning of a line and have a
double bar at the end of the previous line, use
@example
@dots{} \bar "||:" \break 
\repeat volta 2 @{ @dots{} 
@end example
see @ref{Bar lines} for more information.

@seealso

Program reference: @internalsref{VoltaBracket},
@internalsref{RepeatedMusic},
@internalsref{VoltaRepeatedMusic}, and
@internalsref{UnfoldedRepeatedMusic}.

Examples:

Brackets for the repeat are normally only printed over the topmost
staff.  This can be adjusted by moving @code{Volta_engraver} to the
Staff context where you want the brackets to appear;
see @ref{Modifying context plug-ins} and

@lsr{repeats,volta@/-multi@/-staff@/.ly}.


@refbugs

@cindex repeat, ambiguous

A nested repeat like

@example
\repeat @dots{}
\repeat @dots{}
\alternative
@end example

@noindent
is ambiguous, since it is is not clear to which @code{\repeat} the
@code{\alternative} belongs.  This ambiguity is resolved by always
having the @code{\alternative} belong to the inner @code{\repeat}.
For clarity, it is advisable to use braces in such situations.

Timing information is not remembered at the start of an alternative,
so after a repeat timing information must be reset by hand; for
example, by setting @code{Score.measurePosition} or entering
@code{\partial}.  Similarly, slurs or ties are also not repeated.


@anchor{Repeats and MIDI}
@unnumberedsubsubsec Repeats and MIDI

@cindex expanding repeats
@funindex \unfoldRepeats

With a little bit of tweaking, all types of repeats can be present
in the MIDI output.  This is achieved by applying the
@code{\unfoldRepeats} music function.  This function changes all
repeats to unfold repeats.

@lilypond[quote,verbatim,fragment,line-width=8.0\cm]
\unfoldRepeats {
  \repeat tremolo 8 {c'32 e' }
  \repeat percent 2 { c''8 d'' }

  \alternative {
    { g' a' a' g' }
    {f' e' d' c' }
  }
}
\bar "|."
@end lilypond

When creating a score file using @code{\unfoldRepeats} for MIDI,
it is necessary to make two @code{\score} blocks: one for MIDI (with
unfolded repeats) and one for notation (with volta, tremolo, and
percent repeats).  For example,

@example
\score @{
  @var{..music..}
  \layout @{ .. @}
@}
\score @{
  \unfoldRepeats @var{..music..}
  \midi @{ .. @}
@}
@end example

@anchor{Measure repeats}
@unnumberedsubsubsec Measure repeats

@cindex percent repeats
@cindex measure repeats

In the @code{percent} style, a note pattern can be repeated.  It is
printed once, and then the pattern is replaced with a special sign.
Patterns of one and two measures are replaced by percent-like signs,
patterns that divide the measure length are replaced by slashes.
Percent repeats must be declared within a @code{Voice} context.

@lilypond[quote,verbatim,ragged-right]
\new Voice \relative c' {
  \repeat percent 4 { c4 }
  \repeat percent 2 { c2 es2 f4 fis4 g4 c4 }
}
@end lilypond

Measure repeats of more than 2 measures get a counter, if you switch
on the @code{countPercentRepeats} property,

@lilypond[relative=2,fragment,quote,verbatim,ragged-right]
\new Voice {
\set countPercentRepeats = ##t
  \repeat percent 4 { c1 }
}
@end lilypond



Isolated percents can also be printed. This is done by putting a
multi-measure rest with a different print function,
