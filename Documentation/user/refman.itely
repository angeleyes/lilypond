@c . {Overview}
@node Overview
@section Overview


The purpose of LilyPond is explained informally by the term `music
typesetter'.  This is not a fully correct name: not only does the
program print musical symbols, it also makes esthetic decisions.  All
symbols and their placement is @emph{generated} from a high-level
musical description.  In other words, LilyPond would be best described
by `music compiler' or `music to notation compiler'.

Internally, LilyPond is written in a mixture of Scheme and C++. Most of
the algorithms and low-level routines are written in C++, but these low
level components are glued together using Scheme data
structures. LilyPond is linked to GUILE, GNU's Scheme library for
extension.

When lilypond is run to typeset sheet music, the following happens:

@itemize @bullet
@item GUILE Initialization: various scheme files are read
@item parsing: first standard .ly initialization  files are read, and
then the user @file{.ly} file is read.
@item interpretation: the music in the file is processed "in playing
order", i.e. in the same order as your eyes scan sheet music, and in the
same order that you hear the notes play.

@item typesetting:
in this step, the results of the interpretation, a typesetting
specification, is solved.

@item the visible results ("virtual ink") is written to the output file.
@end itemize

These stages, involve data of a specific type: during parsing,
@strong{Music} objects are created.  During the interpretation,
@strong{context} is constructed, and with this context af network of
@strong{graphical objects} (``grobs'') is created. The grobs contain
unknown variables, and the network forms a set of equations. After
solving the equations and filling in these variables, the printed output
(in the form of @strong{molecules}) is written to an output file.

These threemanship of tasks (parsing, translating, typesetting) and
data-structures (music, context, graphical objects) permeates the entire
design of the program.  This manual is ordered in terms of user
tasks. With each concept will be explained to which of the three parts
it belongs.

LilyPond input can be classified  into three types:
@itemize @bullet
  @item musical expressions: a musical expression is some combination of
rest, notes, lyrics
  @item output definitions: recipes for translating those musical
expressions into performances (MIDI) or graphics (eg. PostScript).

  @item declarations: by declaring and naming musical expressions, you
can enter and edit them in manageable chunks.
@end itemize

Apply allows a Scheme-function to operate directly on the internal

@end example
The function takes two arguments, being a function and an musical
argument for that function. The function should return a music
expression.

This example replaces the text string of a script. It also shows a dump
of the music it processes.
@lilypond[verbatim]

@c .  {Repeat}
@node Repeats
@section Repeats


@cindex repeats
@cindex @code{\repeat}

In order to specify repeats, use the @code{\repeat}
keyword.  Since repeats look and sound differently when played or
printed, there are a few different variants of repeats.

@table @asis
@item unfolded  
Repeated music is fully written (played) out.  Useful for MIDI
output.

@item volta  
This is the normal notation: Repeats are not written out, but
alternative endings (voltas) are printed, left to right.

@item folded  
Alternative endings are written stacked.  Which is unfortunately not
practical for anything right now.

@item tremolo
Make tremolo beams.
@end table

* Manual repeat commands::      
* Tremolo repeats::             
* Tremolo subdivision::         
@end menu

@node Repeat syntax
@subsection Repeat syntax

The syntax for repeats is

@example
  \repeat @var{variant} @var{repeatcount} @var{repeatbody}
@end example

If you have alternative endings, you may add

@cindex @code{\alternative}
@example
 \alternative @code{@{} @var{alternative1}
            @var{alternative2}
            @var{alternative3} @dots{} @code{@}}
@end example

where each @var{alternative} is a Music expression.

Normal notation repeats are used like this:

@quotation

@lilypond[fragment,verbatim]
  c'1
  \repeat volta 2 { c'4 d' e' f' }
  \repeat volta 2 { f' e' d' c' }
@end lilypond
@end quotation

With alternative endings:

@quotation

@lilypond[fragment,verbatim]
  c'1
  \repeat volta 2 {c'4 d' e' f'} 
  \alternative { {d'2 d'} {f' f} }
@end lilypond
@end quotation

Folded repeats look like this:@footnote{Folded repeats offer little
more over simultaneous music.  However, it is to be expected that
more functionality -- especially for the MIDI backend -- will be
implemented at some point in the future.}

@quotation

@lilypond[fragment,verbatim]
  c'1
  \repeat fold 2 {c'4 d' e' f'} 
  \alternative { {d'2 d'} {f' f} }

@end lilypond
@end quotation


If you don't give enough alternatives for all of the repeats, then
the first alternative is assumed to be repeated often enough to equal
the specified number of repeats.

@quotation
@lilypond[fragment,verbatim]
\context Staff {
  \relative c' {
    \partial 4;
    \repeat volta 3 { e | c2 d2 | e2 f2 | }
    \alternative { { g4 g g } { a | a a a a | b2. } }
  }
}

@end lilypond
@end quotation


As you can see, LilyPond doesn't remember the timing information, nor
are slurs or ties repeated. We hope to fix this after 1.4.

It is possible to nest @code{\repeat}, although it probably is only
meaningful for nested repeats.

@node Manual repeat commands
@subsection Manual repeat commands

@cindex @code{repeatCommands}

The property @code{repeatCommands} can be used to control the layout of
repeats. Its value is a Scheme list of repeat commands, where each repeat
command can be

@table @code
@item 'start-repeat
 Print a |: bar line
@item 'stop-repeat
 Print a :| bar line
@item (volta . @var{text})
  Print a volta bracket saying @var{text}.
@item (volta . #f)
  Stop a running volta bracket
@end table

@lilypond[verbatim, fragment]
 c''4
    \property Score.repeatCommands = #'((volta "93") end-repeat)
 c4 c4
    \property Score.repeatCommands = #'((volta #f))
 c4 c4
@end lilypond


@node Tremolo repeats
@subsection Tremolo repeats
@cindex tremolo beams

To place tremolo marks between notes, use @code{\repeat} with tremolo
style.  
@lilypond[verbatim,center]
\score { 
  \context Voice \notes\relative c' {
    \repeat "tremolo" 8 { c16 d16 }
    \repeat "tremolo" 4 { c16 d16 }    
    \repeat "tremolo" 2 { c16 d16 }
    \repeat "tremolo" 4 c16
  }
  \paper {
    linewidth = 40*\staffspace;
  }  
}
@end lilypond

@node Tremolo subdivision
@subsection Tremolo subdivision
@cindex tremolo marks
@cindex @code{tremoloFlags}

Tremolo marks can be printed on a single note by adding
`@code{:}[@var{length}]' after the note.  The length must be at least 8.
A @var{length} value of 8 gives one line across the note stem.  If the
length is omitted, then the last value is used, or the value of the
@code{tremoloFlags} property if there was no last value.

@lilypond[verbatim,fragment,center]
  c'2:8 c':32
@end lilypond

Tremolos in this style do not carry over into the MIDI output.

Using this mechanism pays off when you entering many tremolos, since the
default argument saves a lot of typing.

@c .  {Notes mode}
@node Notes mode
@subsection Notes mode

@cindex note mode

@cindex @code{\notes}
Note mode is introduced by the keyword
@code{\notes}.  In Note mode, words can only
contain alphabetic characters.  If @code{word} is encountered,
LilyPond first checks for a notename of @code{word}.  If no
notename is found, then @code{word} is treated as a string.

Since combinations of numbers and dots are used for indicating
durations, it is not possible to enter real numbers in this mode.

@cindex Notes mode

@c .  {Pitches}
@node Pitches
@subsection Pitches

@cindex Pitch names
@cindex Note specification
@cindex pitches
@cindex entering notes

The verbose syntax for pitch specification is

@cindex @code{\pitch}
@example
  \pitch @var{scmpitch}
@end example

@var{scmpitch} is a pitch scheme object, see @ref{Pitch data type}.

In Note and Chord mode, pitches may be designated by names.  The default
names are the Dutch note names.  The notes are specified by the letters
@code{c} through @code{b}, where @code{c} is an octave below middle C
and the letters span the octave above that C.  In Dutch,
@cindex note names, Dutch
a sharp is formed by adding @code{-is} to the end of a pitch name.  A
flat is formed by adding @code{-es}. Double sharps and double flats are
obtained by adding @code{-isis} or @code{-eses}.  @code{aes} and
@code{ees} are contracted to @code{as} and @code{es} in Dutch, but both
forms will be accepted.

LilyPond has predefined sets of notenames for various other languages.
To use them, simply include the language specific init file.  For
example: @code{\include "english.ly"}.  The available language files and
the names they define are:

@example 
                        Note Names               sharp       flat
nederlands.ly  c   d   e   f   g   a   bes b   -is         -es
english.ly     c   d   e   f   g   a   bf  b   -s/-sharp   -f/-flat
deutsch.ly     c   d   e   f   g   a   b   h   -is         -es
norsk.ly       c   d   e   f   g   a   b   h   -iss/-is    -ess/-es
svenska.ly     c   d   e   f   g   a   b   h   -iss        -ess
italiano.ly    do  re  mi  fa  sol la  sib si  -d          -b
catalan.ly     do  re  mi  fa  sol la  sib si  -d/-s       -b 
@end example 

@cindex @code{'}
@cindex @code{,}




The optional octave specification takes the form of a series of
single quote (`@code{'}') characters or a series of comma
(`@code{,}') characters.  Each @code{'} raises the pitch by one
octave; each @code{,} lowers the pitch by an octave.

@c .  {Defining pitch names}
@node Defining pitch names
@subsection Defining pitch names

@cindex defining pitch names
@cindex pitch names, defining 

Note names and chord modifiers can be customised for nationalities.  The
syntax is as follows.

@cindex @code{\pitchnames}
@cindex @code{\chordmodifiers}
@example
   \pitchnames @var{scheme-alist}
   \chordmodifiers @var{scheme-alist}
@end example

See @file{ly/nederlands.ly} and @file{ly/chord-modifiers.ly} for
specific examples how to do this.  Some national note names have been
provided, among others: Norwegian, Swedish, German, Italian, Catalan,
French, Dutch and English.


@c .  {Durations}
@node Durations
@subsection Durations


@cindex duration
@cindex @code{\duration}

The syntax for an verbose duration specification is
@example
 \duration @var{scmduration}
@end example

In Note, Chord, and Lyrics mode, durations may be designated by numbers
and dots: durations are entered as their reciprocal values.  For notes
longer than a whole note, use identifiers.

@quotation

@example 
c'\longa c'\breve  
c'1 c'2 c'4 c'8 c'16 c'32 c'64 c'64 
r\longa r\breve  
r1 r2 r4 r8 r16 r32 r64 r64 
@end example 


@lilypond[]
\score {
  \notes \relative c'' {
    a\longa a\breve  \autoBeamOff
    a1 a2 a4 a8 a16 a32 a64 a64 
    r\longa r\breve  
    r1 r2 r4 r8 r16 r32 r64 r64 
  }
  \paper {
    \translator {
      \StaffContext
        \remove "Clef_engraver";
        \remove "Staff_symbol_engraver";
        \remove "Time_signature_engraver";
        \consists "Pitch_squash_engraver";
    }
  }
}
@end lilypond
@end quotation

As you  can see, the longa is not printed. To get a longa note head, you
have to use a different style of note heads. See [TODO].

If the duration is omitted then it is set equal to the previous duration
entered.  At the start of parsing there is no previous duration, so then
a quarter note is assumed.  The duration can be followed by a dot
(`@code{.}')  to obtain dotted note lengths.
@cindex @code{.}

@lilypond[fragment,verbatim,center]
  a'4. b'4.
@end lilypond
@cindex @code{r}
@cindex @code{s}

You can alter the length of duration by writing `@code{*}@var{fraction}'
after it.  This will not affect the appearance of note heads or rests.

@c . {Notes}
@node Notes
@subsection Notes

A note specification has the form

@example
  @var{pitch}[@var{octavespec}][!][?][@var{duration}]
@end example


LilyPond will determine what accidentals to typeset depending on the key
and context, so alteration refer to what note is heard, not to whether
accidentals are printed.  A reminder accidental
@cindex reminder accidental
@cindex @code{?}
can be forced by adding an exclamation mark @code{!} after the pitch.
A cautionary accidental,
@cindex cautionary accidental

i.e., an accidental within parentheses can be obtained by adding the
question mark `@code{?}' after the pitch.

@lilypond[fragment,verbatim,center]
  cis' d' e' cis'  c'? d' e' c'!
@end lilypond


@c .  {Rests}
@node  Rests
@subsection Rests
@cindex Rests

Rests are entered like notes, with note name `@code{r}'.
There is also a note name
`@code{s}', which produces a space of the specified
duration.


@c .  {Skip}
@node Skip
@subsection Skip
@cindex Skip


@example
  \skip @var{duration} @code{;}
@end example
@cindex @code{\skip}

Skips the amount of time specified by @var{duration}.  If no other
music is played, a gap will be left for the skipped time with no
notes printed.  It works in Note Mode or Lyrics Mode.  In Note mode,
this has the same effect as the spacer rest.

@c .    {Automatic beams}
@subsubsection Automatic beams


@cindex automatic beam generation
@cindex autobeam
@cindex @code{Voice.noAutoBeaming}

LilyPond will group flagged notes and generate beams autmatically, where
appropriate.

This feature can be disabled by setting the @code{Voice.noAutoBeaming}
property to true, which you may find necessary for the melody that goes
with lyrics, eg.  Automatic beaming can easily be overridden for
specific cases by specifying explicit beams. This is discussed in the
next subsubsection.



@cindex @code{Voice.autoBeamSettings}
@cindex @code{(end * * * *)}
@cindex @code{(begin * * * *)}

A large number of Voice properties are used to decide how to generate
beams.  Their default values appear in @file{scm/auto-beam.scm}.  In
general, beams can begin anywhere, but their ending location is
significant.  Beams can end on a beat, or at durations specified by the
properties in @code{Voice.autoBeamSettings}.  To end beams every quarter
note, for example, you could set the property @code{(end * * * *)} to
@code{(make-moment 1 4)}.  To end beams at every three eighth notes you
would set it to @code{(make-moment 1 8)}.  The same syntax can be used
to specify beam starting points using @code{(begin * * * *)}, eg:
@quotation
@example
\property Voice.autoBeamSettings \override
    #'(end * * * *) = #(make-moment 1 4)
\property Voice.autoBeamSettings \override
    #'(begin * * * *) = #(make-moment 1 8)
@end example
@end quotation

To allow different settings for different time signatures, instead of
the first two asterisks @code{* *} you can specify a time signature; use
@code{(end N M * *)} to restrict the definition to
`@var{N}@code{/}@var{M}' time.  For example, to specify beams ending
only for 6/8 time you would use the property @code{(end 6 8 * *)}.

To allow different endings for notes of different durations, instead of
th last two asterisks you can specify a duration; use @code{(end * * N
M)} to restrict the definition to beams that contain notes of
`@var{N}@code{/}@var{M}' duration.

For example, to specify beam endings for beams that contain 32nd notes,
you would use @code{(end * * 1 32)}.



@c .    {Manual beams}
@cindex Automatic beams
@subsubsection Manual beams
@cindex beams, manual
@cindex @code{]}
@cindex @code{[}

In some cases it may be necessary to override LilyPond's automatic
beaming algorithm.  For example, the auto beamer will not beam over
rests or bar lines, so if you want that, specify the begin and end point
manually using @code{[} and @code{]}:

@quotation
@lilypond[fragment,relative,verbatim]
  \context Staff {
    r4 [r8 g'' a r8] r8 [g | a] r8
  }
@end lilypond


@cindex @code{stemLeftBeamCount}

If you have specific wishes for the number of beams, you can fully
control the number of beams through the properties
y@code{Voice.stemLeftBeamCount} and @code{Voice.stemRightBeamCount}.

@lilypond[fragment,relative,verbatim]
  \context Staff {
    [f'8 r16 f g a]

Slurs connects chords and try to avoid crossing stems.  A slur is
started with @code{(} and stopped with @code{)}.  The
starting @code{(} appears to the right of the first note in
the slur.  The terminal @code{)} appears to the left of the
first note in the slur.  This makes it possible to put a note in
slurs from both sides:

@node Slur attachments
@subsubsection Slur attachments

The ending of a slur should whenever possible be attached to a note
head.  Only in some instances where beams are involved, LilyPond may
attach a slur to a stem end.  In some cases, you may want to override
LilyPond's decision, e.g., to attach the slur to the stem end.  This can
be done through @code{Voice.Slur}'s grob-property @code{attachment}:


@quotation
@lilypond[fragment,relative,verbatim]
  \property Voice.Slur \set #'direction = #1
  \property Voice.Stem \set #'length = #5.5
  g''8(g)g4
  \property Voice.Slur \set #'attachment = #'(stem . stem)
  g8(g)g4
@end lilypond
@end quotation

Similarly, slurs can be attached to note heads even when beams are
involved:

@quotation
@lilypond[fragment,relative,verbatim]
  \property Voice.Slur \set #'direction = #1
  \property Voice.Slur \set #'attachment = #'(head . head)
  g''16()g()g()g()d'()d()d()d
@end lilypond
@end quotation

If a slur would strike through a stem or beam, LilyPond will move the
slur away vertically (upward or downward).  In some cases, this may
cause ugly slurs that you may want to correct:

@quotation
@lilypond[fragment,relative,verbatim]
  \property Voice.Stem \set #'direction = #1
  \property Voice.Slur \set #'direction = #1
  d'32( d'4 )d8..
  \property Voice.Slur \set #'attachment = #'(stem . stem)
  d,32( d'4 )d8..
@end lilypond
@end quotation

LilyPond will increase the curvature of a slur trying to stay free of
note heads and stems.  However, if the curvature would increase too much,
the slur will be reverted to its default shape.  This decision is based
on @code{Voice.Slur}'s grob-property @code{beautiful} value.  In some
cases, you may find ugly slurs beautiful, and tell LilyPond so by
increasing the @code{beautiful} value:

[hoe  gedefd?? wat betekent beautiful = X?]

Tuplets are made out of a music expression by multiplying their duration
with a fraction.

The duration of @var{musicexpr} will be multiplied by the fraction. 
In print, the fraction's denominator will be printed over the notes,
optionally with a bracket.  The most common tuplet is the triplet in
which 3 notes have the length of 2, so the notes are 2/3 of
their written length:

@example
  \grace @var{musicexpr}

A grace note expression has duration 0; the next real note is
assumed to be the main note.

You cannot have the grace note after the main note, in terms of
duration, and main notes, but you can typeset the grace notes to the
right of the main note using the property
@code{graceAlignPosition}.
@cindex @code{flagStyle}

When grace music is interpreted, a score-within-a-score is set up:
@var{musicexpr} has its own time bookkeeping, and you could (for
example) have a separate time signature within grace notes.  While in
this score-within-a-score, you can create notes, beams, slurs, etc.
Unbeamed eighth notes and shorter by default have a slash through the
stem.  This behavior can be controlled with the
@code{flagStyle} property.

@quotation
@lilypond[fragment,verbatim]
\relative c'' {
  \grace c8 c4 \grace { [c16 c16] } c4
  \grace { \property Grace.flagStyle = "" c16 } c4
}

@end lilypond
@end quotation


At present, nesting @code{\grace} notes is not supported. The following
may cause run-time errors:
@example
  @code{\grace @{ \grace c32 c16 @} c4}
@end example
Since the meaning of such a construct is unclear, we don't consider
this a loss.  Similarly, juxtaposing two @code{\grace} sections is
syntactically valid, but makes no sense and may cause runtime errors.

Ending a staff or score with grace notes may also generate a run-time
error, since there will be no main note to attach the grace notes to.

The present implementation is not robust and generally kludgy. We expect
it to change after LilyPond 1.4. Syntax changes might also be
implemented.

@cindex Lyrics mode

@cindex lyric mode
@cindex @code{\lyrics}

Lyrics mode is introduced by the keyword @code{\lyrics}.  This mode has
rules that make it easy to include punctuation and diacritical marks in
words: The purpose of Lyrics mode is that you can enter lyrics in @TeX{}
format or a standard encoding without needing quotes.  The precise
definition of this mode is ludicrous, and this will remain so until the
authors of LilyPond acquire a deeper understanding of character
encoding, or someone else steps up to fix this.

A word in Lyrics mode begins with: an alphabetic character, @code{_},
@code{?}, @code{!}, @code{:}, @code{'}, the control characters @code{^A}
through @code{^F}, @code{^Q} through @code{^W}, @code{^Y}, @code{^^},
any 8-bit character with ASCII code over 127, or a two-character
combination of a backslash followed by one of @code{`}, @code{'},
@code{"}, or @code{^}.

Subsequent characters of a word can be any character that is not a digit
and not white space.  One important consequence of this is that a word
can end with `@code{@}}', which may be confusing. However, LilyPond will
issue a warning.  Any @code{_} character which appears in an unquoted
word is converted to a space.  This provides a mechanism for introducing
spaces into words without using quotes.  Quoted words can also be used
in Lyrics mode to specify words that cannot be written with the above
rules.  Here are some examples.  Not all of these words are printable by
@TeX{}.

@example 
Ah!             % a word
2B_||_!2B       % not a word because it starts with a digit
``Hello''       % not a word because it starts with `
_ _ _ _         % 4 words, each one a space 
@end example 

Since combinations of numbers and dots are used for indicating
durations, you can not enter real numbers in this mode.

@cindex lyrics expressions

Syllables are entered like notes, with pitches replaced by text.  For
example, @code{Twin-4 kle4 twin-4 kle4} enters four syllables, each
with quarter note duration.  Note that the hyphen has no special
meaning for lyrics, and does not introduce special symbols.  See
section @ref{Lexical modes} for a description of what is interpreted as
lyrics.

Spaces can be introduced into a lyric either by using quotes
(@code{"}) or by using an underscore without quotes: @code{He_could4
not4}.  All unquoted underscores are converted to spaces.  Printing
lyrics is discussed in the next section.


@c .  {Printing lyrics}
@node Printing lyrics
@subsection Printing lyrics
@cindex lyrics


Lyric syllables must be interpreted within a @code{Lyrics} context for
printing them. Here is a full example:

@quotation
@lilypond[verbatim]
\score {
  <
    \notes \transpose c'' {
      c d e c | c d e c |
      e f g2 | e4 f g2 \bar "|.";

      Va-4 der Ja- cob Va- der Ja- cob
      Slaapt gij nog?2 Slaapt4 gij nog?2
    }
  >
}

@end lilypond
@end quotation




@cindex extender
@cindex lyric extender

You may want a continuous line after the syllables to show melismata. 
To achieve this effect, add a @code{__} lyric as a separate word
after the lyric to be extended.  This will create an extender, a line
that extends over the entire duration of the lyric.  This line will
run all the way to the start of the next lyric, so you may want to

@cindex Lyric hyphen

If you want to have hyphens centered between syllables (rather than
attached to the end of the first syllable) you can use the special
`@code{-}@code{-}' lyric as a separate word between syllables.  This
will result in a hyphen which length varies depending on the space
between syllables, and which will be centered between the syllables. 
For example:

@quotation

@lilypond[verbatim]

      e f g2 | e4 f g2 \bar "|.";

[explain automatic phrasing]
@cindex automatic lyric durations
@cindex @code{\addlyrics}

If you have lyrics that are set to a melody, you can import the rhythm
of that melody into the lyrics using @code{\addlyrics}.  The syntax for
this is
@example
  \addlyrics @var{musicexpr1 musicexpr2}
@end example

This means that both @var{musicexpr1} and @var{musicexpr2} are
interpreted, but that every non-command atomic music expression
(``every syllable'') in @var{musicexpr2} is interpreted using timing
of @var{musicexpr1}.
@cindex @code{automaticMelismata}

If the property @code{automaticMelismata} is set in the
context of @var{musicexpr1}, no lyrics will be put on slurred or tied
notes.

@quotation
@lilypond[verbatim,fragment]
\addlyrics
\transpose c'' {
  \property Voice.automaticMelismata = ##t
  c8 () cis d8. e16 f2
}
\context Lyrics \lyrics {
 do4 re mi fa }
@end lilypond
@end quotation

You should use a single rhythm melody, and single rhythm lyrics (a
constant duration is the obvious choice).  If you do not, you will get
undesired effects when using multiple stanzas:

@quotation
@lilypond[verbatim,fragment]
\addlyrics
\transpose c'' {
  c8 () cis d8. e16 f2
}
\context Lyrics \lyrics
< { do4 re mi fa }

It is valid (but probably not very useful) to use notes instead of
lyrics for @var{musicexpr2}.

@cindex Chords mode

Chord mode is introduced by the keyword
@code{\chords}.  It is similar to Note mode, but
words are also looked up in a chord modifier table (containing
@code{maj}, @code{dim}, etc).

Since combinations of numbers and dots are used for indicating
durations, you can not enter real numbers in this mode.  Dashes
and carets are used to indicate chord additions and subtractions,
so scripts can not be entered in Chord mode.

@c .  {Entering named chords}
@node Entering named chords
@subsection Entering named chords
@cindex Chords names

Chord names are a way to generate simultaneous music expressions that
correspond with traditional chord names.  It can only be used in
Chord mode (see section @ref{Lexical modes}).

@example

  @var{tonic}[@var{duration}][@code{-}@var{modifiers}][@code{^}@var{subtractions}][@code{/}@var{inversion}][@code{/+}@var{bass}].
@end example

@var{tonic} should be the tonic note of the chord, and @var{duration}
is the chord duration in the usual notation.  There are two kinds of
modifiers.  One type is @emph{chord additions}, which are obtained by
listing intervals separated by dots.  An interval is written by its
number with an optional @code{+} or @code{-} to indicate raising or
lowering by half a step.  Chord additions has two effects: It adds
the specified interval and all lower odd numbered intervals to the
chord, and it may lower or raise the specified interval.  Intervals
must be separated by a dot (@code{.}).


Throughout these examples, chords have been shifted around the staff
using @code{\transpose}.


@quotation

@lilypond[fragment,verbatim]
\transpose c'' {
  \chords {
    c1  c:3-       c:7     c:8

  }
}

@end lilypond
@end quotation

@cindex @code{aug}
@cindex @code{dim}
@cindex @code{maj}
@cindex @code{sus}

The second type of modifier that may appear after the @code{:} is a
named modifier.  Named modifiers are listed in the file
@file{chord-modifiers.ly}.  The available modifiers are @code{m} and
@code{min} which lower the 3rd half a step, `@code{aug}' which
raises the 5th, `@code{dim}' which lowers the 5th,
`@code{maj}' which adds a raised 7th, and `@code{sus}'
which replaces the 5th with a 4th.

@quotation

\transpose c'' {
  \chords {

Chord subtractions are used to eliminate notes from a chord.  The
notes to be subtracted are listed after a @code{^} character,
separated by dots.

@lilypond[fragment,verbatim,center]
  \transpose c'' {
    \chords {
      c1^3 c:7^5.3 c:8^7
    }
  }
@end lilypond 
@cindex @code{/}

Chord inversions can be specified by appending `@code{/}' and
the name of a single note to a chord.  This has the effect of
lowering the specified note by an octave so it becomes the lowest
note in the chord.  If the specified note is not in the chord, a
warning will be printed.

@lilypond[fragment,verbatim,center]
  \transpose c''' {
    \chords {
      c1 c/e c/g c:7/e
    }
  }

@end lilypond 
@cindex @code{/+}

Bass notes can be added by `@code{/+}' and
the name of a single note to a chord.  This has the effect of
adding the specified note to the chord, lowered by an octave,
so it becomes the lowest note in the chord.

@lilypond[fragment,verbatim,center]
  \transpose c''' {
    \chords {
      c1 c/+c c/+g c:7/+b
    }
  }

@end lilypond 

The most interesting application is printing  chord names, which is
explained in the next subsection.

You should not combine @code{\relative} with named chords. [FIXME]

@c .  {Printing named chords}
@node Printing named chords
@subsection Printing named chords





@cindex printing chord names
@cindex chord names
@cindex chords
@cindex @code{ChordNames}
@cindex @code{ChordNameVoice}

For displaying printed chord names, use the @code{ChordNames} and
@code{ChordNameVoice} contexts.  The chords may be entered either using
the notation described above, or directly using simultaneous music.

@quotation
@lilypond[verbatim]
scheme = \notes {
  \chords {a1 b c} <d f g>  <e g b>

  \notes<
    \context ChordNamesVoice \scheme
    \context Staff \transpose c'' \scheme
  >
  \paper { linewidth = -1.; }
}
@end lilypond
@end quotation

You can make the chord changes stand out more by setting property
@code{ChordNames.chordChanges} to true.  This will only display chord
names when there's a change in the chords scheme, but always display the
chord name after a line break:

@c bug
@quotation
@lilypond[verbatim]
scheme = \chords {

    \translator {
      \ChordNamesContext
      chordChanges = ##t
    }
  }
}
@end lilypond
@end quotation



LilyPond examines chords specified as lists of notes to determine a
name to give the chord. LilyPond will not try to
identify chord inversions or added base, which may result in strange
chord names when chords are entered as a list of pitches:

@quotation
@lilypond[verbatim,center]
scheme = \notes {
  <c'1 e' g'>
  <e' g' c''>
  <e e' g' c''>
}

\score {

    \context Staff \scheme
  >
  \paper { linewidth = -1.; }
}
@end lilypond
@end quotation

To specify chord inversions, append @code{/<notename>}.  To specify an
added bass note, append @code{/+<notename}:

@quotation
@lilypond[verbatim,center]
scheme = \chords {
  d1 d/a d/+gis

@end lilypond
@end quotation

The chord names that LilyPond should print are fully customizable.  The
code to print chord names is written in Scheme. It can be found in
@file{scm/chord-name.scm}.  Chord names are based on Banter style
naming, which is unambiguous and has a logical structure.  Typical
American style chord names are implemented as a variation on Banter
names, they can be selected by setting property @code{ChordName.style}
to @code{american}:

The Feta font provides musical symbols at six different sizes.  These
fonts are 11 point, 13 point, 16 point, 20 point,
23 point, and 26 point.  The point size of a font is the
height of the five lines in a staff when displayed in the font.

Definitions for these sizes are the files @file{paperSZ.ly}, where
@code{SZ} is one of 11, 13, 16, 20, 23 and 26.  If you include any of
these files, the identifiers @code{paperEleven}, @code{paperThirteen},
@code{paperSixteen}, @code{paperTwenty}, @code{paperTwentythree}, and
@code{paperTwentysix} are defined respectively.  The default

specification, you must set the font as described above.  If you want
the default font, then use the 20 point font.  The new paper size will
not take effect if the font is not loaded and selected afterwards.

@cindex breaking lines

Line breaks are normally computed automatically. They are chosen such
that the resulting spacing has low variation, and looks neither cramped
nor loose.

Occasionally you might want to override the automatic breaks; you can do
this by specifying @code{\break}. This will force a line break at this
point. Do remember that line breaks can only occur at places where there
are barlines.  If you want to have a line break where there is no
barline, you can force a barline by entering @code{\bar "";}.

Similarly, @code{\noBreak} forbids a  line break at a certain point.

@cindex @code{\penalty}

The @code{\break} and @code{\noBreak} commands are defined in terms of
the penalty command:
@example
  \penalty @var{int} @code{;}

@cindex relative octave specification

Octaves are specified by adding @code{'} and @code{,} to pitch names.
When you copy existing music, it is easy to accidentally put a pitch in
the wrong octave and hard to find such an error.  To prevent these
errors, LilyPond features octave entry.

@cindex @code{\relative}
@example
  \relative @var{startpitch} @var{musicexpr}
@end example

The octave of notes that appear in @var{musicexpr} are calculated as
follows: If no octave changing marks are used, the basic interval
between this and the last note is always taken to be a fourth or less.
  The octave changing marks @code{'} and @code{,} can then
be added to raise or lower the pitch by an extra octave.  Upon entering
relative mode, an absolute starting pitch must be specified that will
act as the predecessor of the first note of @var{musicexpr}.

This distance is determined without regarding accidentals: a
@code{fisis} following a @code{ceses} will be put above the
@code{ceses}.

Entering scales is straightforward in relative mode.

@lilypond[fragment,verbatim,center]
  \relative c'' {
    g a b c d e f g g, g
  }
@end lilypond

And octave changing marks are used for intervals greater than a fourth.

@lilypond[fragment,verbatim,center]
  \relative c'' {
    c g c f, c' a, e'' }
@end lilypond

If the preceding item is a chord, the first note of the chord is used
to determine the first note of the next chord.  But other notes
within the second chord are determined by looking at the immediately
preceding note.

@lilypond[fragment,verbatim,center]
  \relative c' {
    c <c e g> 
    <c' e g>
    <c, e' g>
  }
@end lilypond 
@cindex @code{\notes}

The pitch after the @code{\relative} contains a notename.  To parse
the pitch as a notename, you have to be in note mode, so there must
be a surrounding @code{\notes} keyword (which is not
shown here).

The relative conversion will not affect @code{\transpose} or
@code{\relative} sections in its argument.  If you want to use
relative within transposed music, you must place an additional
@code{\relative} inside the @code{\transpose}.

@subsection Context definitions

@cindex context definition
@cindex translator definition
@cindex engraver hacking


A notation contexts is defined by the following information

@enumerate 1
  @item  A name.

  @item  The LilyPond modules that do the actual conversion of music to
       notation.  Each module is a so-called
       @emph{engraver}
@cindex engraver
.

  @item  How these modules should cooperate, i.e. which ``cooperation
       module'' should be used.  This cooperation module is a special
       type of engraver.

  @item  What other contexts the context can contain,

  @item  What properties are defined.
@end enumerate

A context definition has this syntax:

@example

  \translator @code{@{}
                      @var{translatorinit} @var{translatormodifierlist}
                    @code{@}}
@end example

@var{translatorinit} can be an identifier or 
@example
  \type @var{typename} @code{;}
@end example
where @var{typename} is one of

@table @code
@cindex @code{Engraver_group_engraver}
  @item @code{Engraver_group_engraver}  
    The standard cooperation engraver.
@cindex @code{Score_engraver}

  @item @code{Score_engraver}  
    This is cooperation module that should be in the top level context.
@cindex @code{Grace_engraver_group}

  @item @code{Grace_engraver_group}  
    This is a special cooperation module (resembling
    @code{Score_engraver}) that is used to created an embedded
    `miniscore'.
@end table 

@var{translatormodifierlist} is a list of items where each item is
one of

@itemize @bullet
  @item  @code{\consists} @var{engravername} @code{;}  
    Add @var{engravername} to the list of modules in this context. 
  The order of engravers added with @code{\consists} is
    significant.
  
  @item  @code{\consistsend} @var{engravername} @code{;}  
    Analogous to @code{\consists}, but makes sure that
    @var{engravername} is always added to the end of the list of
    engravers.

    Some engraver types need to be at the end of the list; this
    insures they are put there, and stay there, if a user adds or
    removes engravers.  This command is usually not needed for
    end-users.
    
  @item  @code{\accepts} @var{contextname} @code{;}  
    Add @var{contextname} to the list of  context this context can
    contain.  The first listed context is the context to create by
    default.

  @item @code{\denies}. The opposite of @code{\accepts}. Added for
completeness, but is never used in practice.
 
  
  @item  @code{\remove} @var{engravername} @code{;}  
    Remove a previously added (with @code{\consists}) engraver.
  
  @item  @code{\name} @var{contextname} @code{;}  
    This sets name of the context, e.g. @code{Staff}, @code{Voice}.  If
    the name is not specified, the translator won't do anything.

  @item  @var{propname} @code{=} @var{value} @code{;}  
    A property assignment.
@end itemize

In the @code{\paper} block, it is also possible to define translator
identifiers.  Like other block identifiers, the identifier can only
be used as the very first item of a translator.  In order to define
such an identifier outside of @code{\score}, you must do

@quotation

@example 
\paper @{
  foo = \translator @{ @dots{} @}
@}
\score @{
  \notes @{
    @dots{}
  @}
  \paper @{
    \translator @{ \foo @dots{} @}
  @}
@} 
@end example 

@end quotation


@cindex paper types, engravers, and pre-defined translators

Some pre-defined identifiers can simplify modification of
translators.  The pre-defined identifiers are:

@table @code
@cindex @code{StaffContext}
  @item @code{StaffContext}  
    Default Staff context. 
@cindex @code{RhythmicStaffContext}

  @item @code{RhythmicStaffContext}  
    Default RhythmicStaff context. 
@cindex @code{VoiceContext}

  @item @code{VoiceContext}  
    Default Voice context.  
@cindex @code{ScoreContext}

  @item @code{ScoreContext}  
    Default Score context. 

@cindex @code{HaraKiriStaffContext}

  @item @code{HaraKiriStaffContext}  
    Staff context that does not print if it only contains rests. 
    Useful for orchestral scores.@footnote{Harakiri, also called
    Seppuku, is the ritual suicide of the Japanese Samourai warriors.}

@end table

Using these pre-defined values, you can remove or add items to the
translator:

@quotation

@example 
\paper @{
  \translator @{
    \StaffContext
    \remove Some_engraver;
    \consists Different_engraver;
  @}
@} 
@end example 

@end quotation

      


@c .  {Notation Contexts}
@node Notation Contexts
@subsection Notation Contexts

@cindex notation contexts

Notation contexts are objects that only exist during a run of
LilyPond.  During the interpretation phase of LilyPond, the Music
expression contained in a @code{\score} block is interpreted in time
order.  This is the order in which humans read, play, and write
music.

A context is an object that holds the reading state of the
expression; it contains information like

@itemize @bullet
  @item What notes are playing at this point?
  @item What symbols will be printed at this point?
  @item In what style will they printed?
  @item What is the current key signature, time signature, point within
       the measure, etc.?
@end itemize

Contexts are grouped hierarchically: A @code{Voice} context is
contained in a @code{Staff} context (because a staff can contain
multiple voices at any point), a @code{Staff} context is contained in
a @code{Score}, @code{StaffGroup}, or @code{ChoirStaff} context (because
these can all contain multiple staffs).

Contexts associated with sheet music output are called @emph{notation
contexts}, those for sound output are called performance contexts.

Contexts are created either manually or automatically.  Initially, the
top level music expression is interpreted by the top level context (the
@code{Score} context).  When a atomic music expression (i.e. a note, a
rest, etc.), a nested set of contexts is created that can process these
atomic expressions, as in this example:

@example
\score @{ \notes @{ c4 @} @} 
@end example 

The sequential music, `@code{@{ c4 @}}' is interpreted by @code{Score}
context. When the note @code{c4} itself is interpreted, a set of
contexts is needed that will accept notes.  The default for this is a
@code{Voice} context, contained in a @code{Staff} context.  Creation of
these contexts results in the staff being printed.

@cindex context

You can also create contexts manually, and you probably have to do so
if you want to typeset complicated multiple part material.  If a
`@code{\context} @var{name} @var{musicexpr}' expression is encountered
during the interpretation phase, the @var{musicexpr} argument will be
interpreted with a context of type @var{name}.  If you specify a name,
the specific context with that name is searched.

[type vs id]

If a context of the specified type and name can not be found, a new
one is created.  For example,

@quotation

@lilypond[verbatim]
\score {
  \notes \relative c'' {
    c4 <d4 \context Staff = "another" e4> f
  }
}

@end lilypond
@end quotation

In this example, the @code{c} and @code{d} are printed on the
default staff.  For the @code{e}, a context Staff called
@code{another} is specified; since that does not exist, a new
context is created.  Within @code{another}, a (default) Voice context
is created for the @code{e4}.  When all music referring to a
context is finished, the context is ended as well.  So after the
third quarter, @code{another} is removed.

Almost all music expressions inherit their interpretation context
from their parent.  In other words, suppose that the syntax for a
music expression is

@example

  \keyword @var{musicexpr1} @var{musicexpr2} @dots{}
@end example

When the interpretation of this music expression starts, the context
for @var{musicexpr1}, @var{musicexpr2}, etc. is that of the total
expression.

Lastly, you may wonder, why this:

@quotation

@example 
\score @{
  \notes \relative c'' @{
    c4 d4 e4
  @}
@} 
@end example 

@end quotation

doesn't result in this:

@lilypond[]

  \score {
    \notes \relative c'' {
      <c4> <d4> <e4>
    }
  }

@end lilypond

For the @code{c4}, a default @code{Staff} (with a contained
@code{Voice}) context is created.  After the @code{c4} ends, no
music refers to this default staff, so it would be ended, with the
result shown.  To prevent this inconvenient behavior, the context to
which the sequential music refers is adjusted during the
interpretation.  So after the @code{c4} ends, the context of the
sequential music is also the default @code{Voice} context. 
The @code{d4} gets interpreted in the same context
as @code{c4}.

Properties that are set in one context are inherited by all of the
contained contexts.  This means that a property valid for the
@code{Voice} context can be set in the @code{Score} context (for
example) and thus take effect in all @code{Voice} contexts.

Properties can be preset within the @code{\translator} block
corresponding to the appropriate context.  In this case, the syntax
is

@example
  @var{propname} @code{=} @var{value}
@end example

This assignment happens before interpretation starts, so a
@code{\property} expression will override any predefined settings.

The property settings are used during the interpretation phase.  They
are read by the LilyPond modules where interpretation contexts are
built of.  These modules are called @emph{translators}.  Translators for
notation are called @emph{engravers}, and translators for sound are
called @emph{performers}.

metre, arranger, piece and tagline.

It is customary to put the @code{\header} at the top of the file.

All of the information in a LilyPond input file, is represented as a

@itemize @bullet
@item Input
@item c++-function
@item Music
@item Identifier
@item Translator_def
@item Duration
@item Pitch
@item Score
@item Music_output_def
@item Moment (rational number)
@end itemize

LilyPond also includes some transient object types. Objects of these
types are built during a LilyPond run, and do not `exist' per se within
your input file. These objects are created as a result of your input
file, so you can include commands in the input to manipulate them,
during a lilypond run.

@itemize @bullet
@item Grob: short for Graphical object. See @ref{Grobs}. 
@item Molecule: device-independent page output object,

@item Translator: object that produces audio objects or Grobs. This is
not yet user accessible.
@item Font_metric: object representing a font. (See @ref{Font metrics})

@end itemize


@node Music expressions
@subsection Music expressions

@cindex music expressions

Music in LilyPond is entered as a music expression.  Notes, rests, lyric
syllables are music expressions, and you can combine music expressions
to form new ones, for example by enclosing a list of expressions in
@code{\sequential @{ @}} or @code{< >}.  In this example, a compound
expression is formed out of the quarter note @code{c} and a quarter note
@code{d}:

@example 
\sequential @{ c4 d4 @} 
@end example 

@cindex Sequential music
@cindex @code{\sequential}
@cindex sequential music
@cindex @code{<}
@cindex @code{>}
@cindex Simultaneous music
@cindex @code{\simultaneous}

The two basic compound  music expressions are simultaneous  and
sequential music.

@example
  \sequential @code{@{} @var{musicexprlist} @code{@}}
  \simultaneous @code{@{} @var{musicexprlist} @code{@}}
@end example
For both, there is a shorthand:
@example
  @code{@{} @var{musicexprlist} @code{@}}
@end example
for sequential and
@example
  @code{<} @var{musicexprlist} @code{>}
@end example
for simultaneous music.
Other compound music expressions include
@example
 \repeat @var{expr}
 \transpose @var{pitch} @var{expr}
 \apply @var{func} @var{expr}
 \context @var{type} = @var{id} @var{expr}
 \times @var{fraction} @var{expr}
@end example

In principle, the way in which you nest sequential and simultaneous to
produce music is not relevant.  In the following example, three chords
are expressed in two different ways:

@lilypond[fragment,verbatim,center]
  \notes \context Voice {
    <a c'> <b  d' > <c' e'>
    < { a b  c' } { c' d' e' } >
  }
@end lilypond

However, in some cases, LilyPond will also try to choose contexts, and
use the structure of the music expression  to do so. This can have
undesired effects: for example, LilyPond will create a separate staff
for each note if you start a @code{\score} with a  chord:
@lilypond[verbatim,center]
  \score {
    \notes <c''4 e''>
    \paper {
      linewidth = -1.;
    }
  }
@end lilypond
  The solution is to explicitly instantiate the context you desire.
In this case this is typically a Voice context
@lilypond[verbatim,center]
  \score {
    \notes\context Voice <c''4 e''>
    \paper {
      linewidth = -1.;
    }
  }
@end lilypond
If you use @code{\context Staff} you will get separate stems for each
note head, leading to collisions, so don't use that.



@c .   {Assignments}
@node Assignments
@subsection Assignments
@cindex Assignments

Identifiers allow objects to be assigned to names during the parse
stage.  To assign an identifier, you use @var{name}@code{=}@var{value}
and to refer to an identifier, you preceed its name with a backslash:
`@code{\}@var{name}'.  @var{value} is any valid Scheme value or any of
the input-types listed above.  Identifier assignments can appear at top
level in the LilyPond file, but also in @code{\paper} blocks.

Semicolons are forbidden after top level assignments, but mandatory in
other places. The rules about semicolons and assignments are very
confusing, but when LilyPond input evolves more towards Scheme, we hope
that this problem will grow smaller.

An identifier can be created with any string for its name, but you will
only be able to refer to identifiers whose names begin with a letter,
being entirely alphabetical.  It is impossible to refer to an identifier
whose name is the same as the name of a keyword.

The right hand side of an identifier assignment is parsed completely
before the assignment is done, so it is allowed to redefine an
identifier in terms of its old value, e.g.

@example
foo = \foo * 2.0
@end example

When an identifier is referenced, the information it points to is
copied.  For this reason, an identifier reference must always be the
first item in a block.
@example
\paper  @{
	foo = 1.0
	\paperIdent % wrong and invalid
@}

\paper @{
	\paperIdent % correct
	foo = 1.0 @}

@cindex Scheme
@cindex GUILE
@cindex Scheme, in-line code


LilyPond contains a Scheme interpreter (the GUILE library) for
internal use. In some places Scheme expressions also form valid syntax:
whereever it is allowed,
@example
  #@var{scheme}
@end example
evaluates the specified Scheme code. If this is used at toplevel, then
the result is discarded. Example:
@example
  \property Staff.TestObject \override #'foobar =  #(+ 1 2)
@end example

@code{\override} expects two Scheme expressions, so there are two Scheme
expressions. The first one is a symbol (@code{foobar}), the second one
an integer (namely, 3).

Begins and ends with the @code{"} character.  To include a @code{"}
character in a string write @code{\"}.  Various other backslash
sequences have special interpretations as in the C language.  A string
that contains no spaces can be written without the quotes.  See
@ref{Lexical modes} for details on unquoted strings; their
interpretation varies depending on the situation.  Strings can be
concatenated with the @code{+} operator.

The tokenizer accepts the following commands. They have no grammatical
function, hence they can appear anywhere in the input.


@c .   {Main input}
@subsubsection Main input
@cindex Main input

@cindex @code{\maininput}

The @code{\maininput} command is used in init files to signal that the
user file must be read. This command cannot be used in a user file.

@c .   {File inclusion}
@subsubsection Main input
@cindex Main input

@subsubsection File inclusion
@cindex @code{\include}
@example
  \include @var{filename}
@end example

Include @var{filename}.  The argument @var{filename} may be a quoted string (an
unquoted string will not work here!) or a string identifier.  The full
filename including the @file{.ly} extension must be given,

@subsubsection Version information 
@cindex @code{\version}
@example
  \version @var{string} ;
@end example

Specify the version of LilyPond that a file was written for.  The
argument is a version string in quotes, for example @code{"1.2.0"}. 
This is used to detect invalid input, and to aid
@code{convert-ly}  a tool that automatically upgrades input files. See
See @ref{convert-ly} for more information on @code{convert-ly}.

@cindex convert-ly


@c .   {Pitch names}
@subsubsection Defining pitch names
@cindex Lexical modes
@cindex definining pitch names
@cindex pitch names, definining
@cindex note names
@cindex chord modifier names

A @code{\paper} block at top level sets the default paper block.  A
@code{\midi} block at top level works similarly.

@c .   {Assignments}
@subsubsection Assignments
@cindex assignments
@cindex @code{#}

Identifier assignments may appear at top level.  @ref{Assignments}



@c .    {Direct scheme}
@subsubsection Direct scheme
@cindex Direct scheme

Scheme statements maybe issued to produce interesting side-effects. 


@c .  {Lexical modes}
@node Lexical modes
@subsection Lexical modes
@cindex Lexical modes
@cindex input mode
@cindex mode, input 
@cindex @code{\notes}
@cindex @code{\chords}
@cindex @code{\lyrics}

To simplify entering notes, lyrics, and chords, LilyPond has three
special input modes on top of the default mode: note, lyrics and chords
mode.  These input modes change the way that normal, unquoted words are
interpreted: for example, the word @code{cis} may be interpreted as a
C-sharp, as a lyric syllable `cis' or as a C-sharp major triad
respectively.

A mode switch is entered as a compound music expressions
@example
@code{\notes} @var{musicexpr}
@code{\chords} @var{musicexpr}
@code{\lyrics}  @var{musicexpr}.
@end example

In each of these cases, these expressions do not add anything to the
meaning of their arguments.  They are just a way to indicate that the
arguments should be parsed in indicated mode.  The modes are treated in
more detail in the sections @ref{Note entry}, @ref{Lyrics} and
@ref{Chords}.

You may nest different input modes.

@c .  {Ambiguities}
@node Ambiguities
@subsection Ambiguities
@cindex ambiguities
@cindex grammar


The grammar contains a number of ambiguities. We hope to resolve them at
some time.

@itemize @bullet
  @item  The assignment

         @example 
foo = bar 
@end example 

       can be interpreted as making a string identifier @code{\foo}
       containing @code{"bar"}, or a music identifier @code{\foo}
       containing the syllable `bar'.

  @item  The assignment

         @example 
foo = -6 
@end example 

       can be interpreted as making an integer identifier
       containing -6, or a Request identifier containing the
       fingering `6' (with neutral direction).

  @item  If you do a nested repeat like

       @quotation

@example 
\repeat @dots{}
\repeat @dots{}
\alternative 
@end example 

       @end quotation

       then it is ambiguous to which @code{\repeat} the
       @code{\alternative} belongs.  This is the classic if-then-else
       dilemma.  It may be solved by using braces.

  @item  (an as yet unidentified ambiguity :-)
@end itemize




@c . {Unsorted}
@node Unsorted
@section Unsorted

[mucho todo]

Translation?

@cindex properties
@unnumberedsubsec Translation property

[todo: add \set/\override/\revert]


@cindex @code{\property}
@example
  \property @var{contextname}.@var{propname} =  @var{value}
@end example

Sets the @var{propname} property of the context @var{contextname} to
the specified @var{value}.  All three arguments are strings. 
Depending on the context, it may be necessary to quote the strings or
to leave space on both sides of the dot.


@cindex output properties
@unnumberedsubsec Output properties

These allow you to tweak what is happening in the back-end
directly. If you want to control every detail of the output
formatting, this is the feature to use. The downside to this is that
you need to know exactly how the backend works. Example:


@lilypond[fragment,verbatim]
\relative c'' { c4
        \context Staff \outputproperty
        	#(make-type-checker 'note-head-interface)
        	#'extra-offset = #'(0.5 . 0.75)
<c8 e g> }
@end lilypond

This selects all note heads occurring at current staff level, and sets
the @code{extra-offset} of those heads to @code{(0.5,0.75)}, shifting them
up and right.

Use of this feature is entirely on your own risk: if you use this, the
result will depend very heavily on the implementation of the backend,
which we change regularly and unscrupulously.


Don't move the finger 2, only text "m.d." ...
@lilypond[verbatim]
#(define (make-text-checker text)
   (lambda (grob) (equal? text (ly-get-elt-property grob 'text))))

\score {    
  \notes\relative c''' {
    \property Voice.Stem \set #'direction = #1
    \outputproperty #(make-text-checker "m.d.")
      #'extra-offset = #'(-3.5 . -4.5)
    a^2^"m.d."    
  }
  \paper { linewidth = -1.; }
}
@end lilypond
