There are a few things that the convert-ly cannot handle. Here's a list of limitations
that the community has complained about.

This bug report structure has been chosen because convert-ly has a structure that doesn't
allow to smoothly implement all needed changes. Thus this is just a wishlist, placed
here for reference.

1.6->2.0:
 Doesn't always convert figured bass correctly, specifically things like {< >}. Mats' comment on working around this:
   To be able to run convert-ly
   on it, I first replaced all occurencies of '{<' to some dummy like '{#'
   and similarly I replaced '>}' with '&}'. After the conversion, I could
   then change back from '{ #' to '{ <' and from '& }' to '> }'.
 Doesn't convert all text markup correctly. In the old markup syntax,
 it was possible to group a number of markup commands together within parentheses, e.g.
   -#'((bold italic) "string")
   This will incorrectly be converted into
   -\markup{{\bold italic} "string"}
   instead of the correct
   -\markup{\bold \italic "string"}
2.0->2.2:
 Doesn't handle \partcombine
 Doesn't do \addlyrics => \lyricsto, this breaks some scores with multiple stanzas.
2.0->2.4:
 \magnify isn't changed to \fontsize.
    - \magnify #m => \fontsize #f, where f = 6ln(m)/ln(2)
 remove-tag isn't changed.
    - \applymusic #(remove-tag '. . .) => \keepWithTag #'. . .
 firstpagenumber isn't changed.
    - firstpagenumber no => printfirstpagenumber = ##f
 Line breaks in header strings aren't converted.
    - \\\\  as line break in \header strings => \markup \center-align <
      "First Line" "Second Line" >
 Crescendo and decrescendo terminators aren't converted.
    - \rced => \!
    - \rc => \!
2.2->2.4:
 \turnOff (used in \set Staff.VoltaBracket = \turnOff) is not properly converted.
2.4.2->2.5.9
 \markup{ \center-align <{ ... }> } should be converted to:
 \markup{ \center-align {\line { ... }} }
 but now, \line is missing.
2.4->2.6
 Special LaTeX characters such as $~$ in text are not converted to UTF8.
