@node Lyrics mode definition
@section Lyrics mode definition

The definition of lyrics mode is ludicrous, and this will remain so
until the authors of LilyPond acquire a deeper understanding of
character encoding, or someone else steps up to fix this.


A word in Lyrics mode begins with: an alphabetic character, @code{_},
@code{?}, @code{!}, @code{:}, @code{'}, the control characters @code{^A}
through @code{^F}, @code{^Q} through @code{^W}, @code{^Y}, @code{^^},
any 8-bit character with ASCII code over 127, or a two-character
combination of a backslash followed by one of @code{`}, @code{'},
@code{"}, or @code{^}.

Subsequent characters of a word can be any character that is not a digit
and not white space.  One important consequence of this is that a word
can end with `@code{@}}', which may be confusing. However, LilyPond will
issue a warning.  Any @code{_} character which appears in an unquoted
word is converted to a space.  This provides a mechanism for introducing
spaces into words without using quotes.  Quoted words can also be used
in Lyrics mode to specify words that cannot be written with the above
rules.
