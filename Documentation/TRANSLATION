LILYPOND DOCUMENTATION TRANSLATION


SOURCES

The sources live in a GIT repository.  Git 1.4.4.1 or newer is
required, and Git 1.5.x is highly recommended.  To get a fresh version
of LilyPond sources run

    mkdir lily ; cd lily
    git init-db
    git fetch git://git.sv.gnu.org/lilypond.git/ refs/heads/lilypond/translation:lilypond/translation
    git checkout -b mytranslations lilypond/translation


GIT

The reader is supposed to be familiar with Git, for example by
having experience from lilypond.org translation; see
http://git.sv.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=lilypond.git;a=blob_plain;f=README;hb=web/master


REQUIREMENTS

Working on LilyPond documentation translations requires:

    * python
    * make
    * gettext


WHICH DOCUMENTATION CAN BE TRANSLATED

The makfiles and scripts infrastructure currently supports translation
of the following documentation:

    * documentation index (HTML)
    * user manual -- Texinfo source, PDF and HTML output; Info output
might be added if there is enough demand for it.


STARTING A TRANSLATION IN A NEW LANGUAGE

At top of the source directory, do

    ./autogen.sh

or (if you want to install your self-compiled LilyPond locally):

    ./autogen.sh --prefix=$HOME

If you want to compile LilyPond -- which is almost required to build
the docs, but is not required to do translation only -- fix all
dependencies and rerun ./configure (with the same options as for
autogen).

Cd into Documentation and run:

    make ISOLANG=<MY-LANGUAGE> new-lang

where <MY-LANGUAGE> is the ISO 639 language code.

Add a language definition for your language in
buildscripts/langdefs.py.

See next section about what files to translate and the following
detailed instructions after the next section.

All the following files are in Documentation/

TRANSLATION DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS

Please follow all these instructions with care to ensure quality work.

All files should be encoded in UTF-8.

* USER MANUAL

Any title which comes with one of the following commands must not be
translated directly in the Texinfo source

@node          @top                                     @majorheading
@chapter       @unnumbered          @appendix           @chapheading
@section       @unnumberedsec       @appendixsec        @heading
@subsection    @unnumberedsubsec    @appendixsubsec     @subheading
@subsubsection @unnumberedsubsubsec @appendixsubsubsec  @subsubheading
@ref           @rglos

As a notable exception, the second argument 'Bar baz' of
@ref{Foo,'Bar baz',,info-file} should be translated.

In any section which looks like

@menu
* node1:: thing1
* node2:: thing2
...
@end menu

the node names (nodeN) are NOT to be translated, whereas extra title
information (thingN) is.


Every node name or section title must from now on be translated
separately in a .po file (just as well as LilyPond output messages).
This .po file should be in Documentation/po.

Make sure to keep *verbatim* copies of music snippets (in @lilypond blocs).
@example blocs do not have to be verbatim copies, e.g. variable names,
file names and comments should be translated.

Index entries (@cindex and so on) should be translated.

Carefully apply every rule exposed in Documentation/README.txt.  If
one of these rules conflicts with a rule specific to your language,
please ask the Translation meister and/or the Documentation Editor on
lilypond-devel@gnu.org.


* DOCUMENTATION INDEX index.html.in

Unlike almost all HTML pages in this documentation, links in this page
are not tweaked by add_html_footer.py, so links should be manually
edited to link to existing translations.


CHECK STATE OF TRANSLATION

First pull, then cd into Documentation (or at top of the source tree,
replace 'make' with 'make -C Documentation') and run

    make ISOLANG=<MY_LANGUAGE> check-translation

This presents a diff of the original files since the most recent
revision of the translation.  To check a single file, run

    python buildscripts/check_translation.py Documentation/<MY-LANGUAGE>/user/foo.itely



UPDATE A TRANSLATION

Texinfo skeleton files, i.e. .itely files not yet translated,
containing only the Texinfo structure can be updated automatically:
whenever 'make check-translation' shows that such files shouldbe
updated, run from Documentation

    make ISOLANG=<MY_LANGUAGE> skeleton-update

.po message catalogs in Documentation/po may be updated with (from
Documentation or Documentation/po)

    make po-update



TECHNICAL BACKGROUND

A number of Python scripts handle a part of the documentation
translation process:

* langdefs.py  -- language definitions
* check_translation.py  -- show diff to update a translation
* texi-langutils.py  -- quickly and dirtily parse Texinfo files to
make message catalogs and Texinfo skeleton files
* texi-skeleton-update.py -- update Texinfo skeleton files
* html-gettext.py -- translate node names, section titles and cross
references in HTML files generated by makeinfo
* add_html_footer.py (module called by www_post.py) -- add footer and
tweak links in HTML pages
* texi-gettext.py -- gettext node names, section titles and references
before calling texi2pdf
* mass-link.py -- link or symlink files between English documentation
and documentation in other languages
