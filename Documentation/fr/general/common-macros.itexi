@c We need this since @q{\} doesn't work with makeinfo 4.11 --
@c say @q{@bs{}} instead.
@c ***** Displaying images not generated by lilypond-book *****
@c Current installation setup of Info docs requires that all images are
@c expected to be found in the `lilypond/' subdirectory.  `lilypond-book'
@c already generates proper @image commands for images of music; these
@c macro definitions do the same for other images.

@c Don't remove the `@c' within the macro definition!  See section 19.3,
@c `Macro Details and Caveats', in the texinfo info file for explanation.
