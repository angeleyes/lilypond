time. () is a slur, which connects notes.  You need to be able to

Q: I want a DOS/NT/W95 port.

A0: Reconsider.  Try Linux.  It-s fun!

A1: Currently (patchlevel 27), LilyPond (and flowerLib) compiles, links
and runs on windhoos-nt, using the cygnus gnu port (release b17.1). 
I (JCN) only had to make a minor workaround for missing library calls.  
Have a look at http://www.cygnus.com/gnu-win32.  To make LilyPond type
make $OS. (I am not promising to maintain this platform, it is just that
when having to use doze, i-m sometimes too lazy to reboot.)

A2: I haven't had time to find a GCC crosscompiler to DOS/win (in rpm,
please :).  

Q: Why GPL?

A: Yes.
