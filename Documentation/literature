Probably the best 2 reference books are:
 
1) ``Teach yourself the art of music engraving and processing'' by Ted Ross   
(3rd edition), published by Hansen House, Miami Beach, FL.
 
Hansen House
1820 West Ave.
Miami, FL  33139
(305) 532-5461
 
This is about *engraving* i.e. professional music typesetting, and includes 
some good spacing tables
 
2) ``Music Notation'' by Gardner Read (2nd edition), published by Taplinger
Publishing, New York.
 
This is as close to the ``standard'' reference work for music notation issues
as one is likely to get.

Prentice-Hall, 1963.
