The size of a grob are determined through callbacks, settable with
grob properties @code{X-extent-callback} and @code{Y-extent-callback}.
There can be only one extent-callback for each axis. No callback
(Scheme value @code{#f}) means: `empty in this direction'. If you fill
in a pair of numbers, that pair hard-codes the extent in that
coordinate.

Offsets of grobs are relative to a parent reference point. Most
positions are not known when an object is created, so these are
calculated as needed. This is done by adding a callback for a specific
direction.

Offset callbacks can be stacked, i.e.

@example
        \property .... \override #'Y-offset-callbacks = #(list
                callback1 callback2 callback3)

@end example

The callbacks will be executed in the order @code{callback3 callback2
callback1}. This is used for quantized positioning: the staccato dot is
above or below a note head, and it must not be on a staff-line.  To
achieve this, the staccato dot has two callbacks: one that positions the
grob above or below the note head, and one that rounds the Y-position of
the grob to the nearest open space.

Some items need special treatment for line breaking. For example, a

line break).  To model this, `breakable' items (clef, key signature,
bar lines, etc.) are copied twice. Then we have three versions of each
breakable item: one version if there is no line break, one version
that is printed before the line break (at the end of a system), one
version that is printed after the line break.

Whether these versions are visible and take up space, is determined by
the outcome of the @code{break-visibility}. This grob property is a
function taking a direction (-1, 0 or 1) as argument. It returns a
