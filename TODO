BUGS
	* first clef

	* position of key acc's

SEVERELY LACKING:

	* grace notes

INPUTLANGUAGE

	* figured bass?

	* transposition

	* voicegroups.

	* rest name configurable

SMALLISH PROJECTS

	* Lookup::tex_glissando, Lookup::tex_bracket,
	Lookup::tex_cresc, Lookup::tex_decresc (use texbeam.cc as an
	example.)

	* Decent TeX titledefs (\tempo, \metron, etc. )

	* command priority into enum
	
	* C meter iso 4/4

	* textspanner: dir of beam.

	* script-spacing

	* Brackets

	* space rest.

	* use (char *) iso. String for communication between lexer and parser.

	* As vs. as  notename.

	* configure idealspacing: arithmetic spacing

	* fix symbols in parser.o: `Warning: size of symbol'

	* Viola clef (->jan?!)

DOC

	* beam generation.

	* all errors

FUTURE

	* Text_pstaff/Lyric_staff

	* put requests on barcommands 

	* glissando

	* guitar chord

	* better beamslope calculation

	* implement better breaking algorithm

	* check out linux -> go32 crosscompiler: dos port

	* Implement all requests

	* QLP for beams?

	* stacked slurs.

	* revise calcideal

	* eentje/tweetje

IDEAS

	* itemcolumns

	* check out PMX

	* dependencies: -> implement children more elegantly. Handle
	spanner with broken deps.

	* use an embedded language: scheme, lisp, S-lang, Perl, ?

	* Broadcasts in Walker of Request and Item.

	* y -dims in internote?

	* hack up mf sources for decent spacing info (and then maybe
	read TFM directly)

	* merge Atom and Symbol?

	* merge Command/Input_command.
	
	* merge common code of Item, Atom/Molecule

	* Spacing_request for manually adjusting spacing

	* Staff_group.

	* SHIT: meters/bars should be aligned, which is difficult if
	we get different keychanges in different staffs.

	* Integrating (objectiveC) MusicKit with LilyPond
	
	* MusixTeX output possible?

	* PostScript output (esp. Beams, Slurs, etc)
