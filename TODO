** Status and planning

[L] The book still needs a lot of work, but it is not insurmountable.
The pieces are there; they need to be re-ordered and integrated
better.

[L] There are still some rough patches - whole pages - that still need
real work.  The general polished sections still have a large number of
English errors.  Some errors collected together; whole sentences need
to be completely rewritten.

[L] This will take an active partnership between the editing staff and
one or more authors.  It will take 2 months or more of a lot of time
(~15hrs a week) on the part of the LilyPond maintainers, and then
another couple of months of occasional follow-up emails as we do the
fine-tooth comb English edits and get it ready for press.


** Manual structure, fitting pieces together

*** [L] SKIP: Regression Tests for Developers -- input/regression

*** Templates -- input/templates/out-www/collated-files.tely
[L] Appendix to the printed manual.

*** Glossary -- Documentation/user/music-glossary.tely
[L] Appendix to the printed manual.

Get authors and license.

*** Examples  -- input/examples 

[L] These (or some of these) need to be integrated into the book.  To
save space, each example should show just one page of music.

[L] The best way is to add an illustrative example as it's own sub-section
within the tutorial, after a section discussing a certain technique,
music issue, or typesetting problem.  For instance, after a discussion
of how to do multi-voice notation, put a half page or one page choral
piece.

[L] I think this extra time is well worth it.  It will add a *lot* of
value to the book relative to the amount of work being done.  (A much
better value/time ratio than the countless necesary-evil hours we
spend doing "fine-tooth comb" English editing.)

[L] Before you spend any time on it, you should post a request to your
mailing list.


*** Compile  -- Documentation/topdocs/INSTALL.texi

[L] Normally, all our technical manuals include a section on How to
Install.  Too terse and UNIX (problems) only.

UNDECIDED: Possibly get info from newweb/site/download/,

*** Program Reference  -- Documentation/user/out-www/lilypond-internals

[L] Big problem.

[L] I leave it up to you to decide which cross
references really must be included and then add the information to the
main text.  Any reference to internal commands that aren't included in
the main text should be cut from the printed version.  We can make a
note in the book that says "for complete information on every single
internal command, see http://www....."

Either add to manual in condensed form (we'll try that first), or
remove all x-references.

*** Tips and Tricks -- input/test/out-www/collated-files.tely

[L] I worry that important updates and helpful advice are lost in
here, instead of integrated into the manuscript.

[L] It sounds like a lot of the material is already completed.  Can you
convert the Templates file into a Texinfo-formatted appendix?

Ask users.


*** SKIP: why switch?  -- newweb/site/switch/advantages.html
*** SKIP: feature list -- newweb/site/about/features.html

[L] Useful source material for me when writing back-cover text, a sales
sheet or ad, but not needing integration into the manual itself.

*** SKIP: crash course -- newweb/site/switch/howto.html

[L] Some part of this might be useful as back-cover text, to help quickly
explain things while someone is standing in a bookstore, thinking
about it.  However, it does not need to be integrated into the
manual.

*** SKIP: faq -- newweb/site/about/faq.html

*** SKIP: essay -- newweb/site/about/automated-engraving/

[L] The majority of the info in this essay has already been added to
the manual.

** Issues

*** INSTALL.texi -- CD

[L] After reading your notes about the compilation problems, I am even
more committed to doing it as a book&CD.

UNDECIDED: [L] I am not going to bother creating a ready-to-run live-CD.
