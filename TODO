general length.  Of course, in the example above I can use \breve.
But what if I want a chord that lasts for 3 whole notes?  Or what
about 2.5 whole notes?  Is there a mechanism for getting this kind of

To answer this, I have to give a little background.  Please say so if
I am being obtuse.

Both audio and notation elements are created decentrally, when
LilyPond says "Interpreting music ... [8][16] etc."  After all
elements are created, they are processed again to calculate all
parameters.  After that is done, they are dumped onto the output (the
MIDI stream or the TeX file).

The audio and notation elements are created by objects called
performer and engraver respectively.  They work by taking a chunk of
input (a so-called request), and using the request to create an audio
or notation element.

After some processing, the engraver sends the created elements to
its enclosing notation/performance context.

In the case of notation, engravers can also modify existing elements
created by sibling engravers.  Eg. the beam-engraver will modify stems
when it creates a beam over a couple of stems.  This is done in
Engraver::do_acknowledge_element () and
Engraver::do_process_acknowledged ().

In the case of audio, there are no mechanisms to modify existing audio
elements. After the audio elements are created, they are sent directly
to the enclosing context (an instance of Performer_group_performer),
through the method Performer::play ()

Concretely spoken, for dynamics you have to write a performer
(Dynamics_performer), that will take the input requests. If I
understand correctly, every MIDI note played must have its dynamic
strength set separately.  That means the the Dynamics_performer must
set the strength of every Audio_note it finds.  This means that one
has to modify existing Audio items.  The best way of doing this is
with a broadcast/acknowledge process.

So the best way of handling this, is

  1 supporting dynamic settings in Audio_note

  2 mimicking the broadcast/acknowledge mechanism of the Engravers in
  the Performers

  3 using that mechanism to write a Dynamics_performer that will modify
  any notes it finds to set appropriate strengths.

You could also kludge this by deriving from Performer_group_performer
a performer that also sets dynamics within notes, but that is not the
elegant way to do it.

I'd say that the work involved is not hard, but you have to be fluent
with C++ and need some insight into the working of Notation Contexts
and friends.  I guess I could do it in a day or so, but if you are not
so fluent with the inner workings of LilyPond, it could take you some
more time (A few more days?).

Please note, that I am *not* going to code this myself: my days are
valuable, and I think I have more interesting things to do than fixing
the MIDI output (I don't even have a soundcard).  But I *do* want to help
you or other people with implementing this, so if you need help, don't
hesitate to ask.

Usually you can get away without having this interlinked structure.
One piece of information you need when exporting objects to scheme is
the smob tag for your class.  You might store this value (a long) into
a class static variable, or a file static variable.  I'll use a class
static variable in this example.

I typically use code that works like this (untested code ahead):

class Foo_class {
    static long *Foo_smob_tag;
    SCM obj; // representation as a scheme object, description comes later
}

// call this once on startup
void init_Foo_class {
    static scm_smobfuns type_rec;

    type_rec.mark = foo_mark;
    type_rec.free = foo_free;
    type_rec.print = foo_display;
    type_rec.equalp = 0;
    Foo_class::Foo_smob_tag = new int(scm_new_smob(type_rec));
}

When you want to export an object to scheme, you put a pointer to the
object itself in the cdr of the cell, and the tag in the car of the
cell.  The code looks like this:

// Is this a Foo?
static int
foo_p(SCM obj)
{
    return(SCM_NIMP(obj) && SCM_CAR(obj) == Foo_class::Foo_smob_tag);
}

// given a Scheme representation, return, a C++ representation
static Foo_class *
foo_unbox(SCM obj)
{
    return((Foo_class*)SCM_CDR(obj));
}

// the SCM representation of the object is stored inside itself
// this will become useful when destructor gets called
static SCM
foo_box(Foo_class *foo)
{
    SCM_DEFER_INTS;
    SCM_NEWCELL(foo->obj);
    SCM_SETCAR(foo->obj, Foo_class::Foo_smob_tag);
    SCM_SETCDR(foo->obj, (SCM)foo);
    SCM_ALLOW_INTS;
    return foo->obj;
}

> C++ determines life time, so what is the strategy?

What happens now when the destructor gets called?  Lets set the cdr to
NULL, and then check for that in all of the primitive functions that
use your smob.  We'll call this notion 'live'; a scheme object is
'live' if the C++ representation still exists, it's dead if the C++
object is gone.  You can still have references to dead objects in
scheme code; it's just an error to use them.  This idea is stolen from
Emacs's handling of buffers ('buffer-live-p' and friends).

Add another function, foo_live_p:

static int
foo_live_p(SCM obj)
{
    return(foo_p(obj) && SCM_CDR(obj) != NULL);
}

In you destructor, you need to do:

~Foo_class()
{
    SCM_CDR(this->obj, NULL);
}

When writing new primitives, now just check foo_live_p().

I hope the above helps,

-russ
