Features you cannot find in the doco as working, should be mentioned here.

This is an assorted collection of stuff that will be done, might be
done, or is an idea that I want to think about

Most of the items are marked in the code as well, with full explanation. 
grep for TODO and ugh/ugr/urg

0.2:
	* w32 blurb

	* make sure all ex's have a mudela-version

	* notes almost touch barline: whitespace at the begin of the bar 
	 should be at fixed at at least (about) one interline.
	 hack at spring-spacer.cc:662 doesn't work anymore

	* do rest-collisions for Multi_measure_rests as well.

	* split error/warning in error/warning/non_fatal_error

	* add a Duration_convert member to Duration_iter to set parameters.
	Junk global duration settings. 
 
	* deps for ly2dvi

	* fix .txt rules / make dist from freshly configured tar-ball

	* document use of ly2dvi more prominently

	* deprecate \duration

	* clean up abbrev/plet/beam/abbrevbeam/duration mess in parser.

 	* minimum length second part broken tie
 
	* en-,discouraged linebreaking: 
	  - handle DISALLOW < penalty > FORCE
	  - discourage breaking of slurs

	* multibar rest
	  - symbol(s)

	* move all hard-coded constants and staffheight dependent to runtime,
	  i.e. init/params.ly.  e.g.: stem length params, beam positions

	* fix variable define/lookup parser global<->paper

 	* fix position of bar number

	* fix position of brace in conjunction with bracket

	* fix title/instrument placements; see input/test/title.ly

	* <\voiceone c4. \voicetwo c4>

	* add full cello suites to web site (kom op, Maarten!)

	* rename
	  - plet -> tuplet
	  - grav -> engraver
	  - measure -> bar
	  - abbreviation-beam -> (measured/unmeasured) tremolo

	* libtoolize flowerlib

	* shared lib

	* robustify Beam (in case of no stems, 32nd notes)

	* check for groff / troff/ nroff et

	* use kpsepath to find all TeX dirs
	- configure.in 
	- clean-fonts.sh

	* nicen examples:
	- remove all \multi
	- break-up heavily-nested score blocks

	* disable spaces in TeX stuff
	
	* handle ^C for tmp/file creation.

	* dots & rest collisions.

	* add a screenshot to the website. :)

	* documentation
	- introduction?
	- info?
	- LaTeX?
	- more manpages?

	* naming Mozarella, Madeira, Muella?

	* versioning for Feta

	* the warning about the negative slur/tie length appears twice
	which is irritating.

	* The `3' in the meter key is a one or two pixels too thin (at 600dpi)
	in the middle:

	* the tenuto script is too long and too thin

	* the bracket is ugly (wings are too parabolic, should be more circular)
	* better hshift (dots, distance, head dependent)

	* stem len adjustable

STUFF
 	* convert-mudela:
	- automatically add  a \version if not present.
	- better parsing
	- make smarter
	- fix convert-mudela -e *.ly ;
	- convert-mudela -e empty.ly
	- redo in python.

        * clefs (AG): The "8" should appear closer to the actual clef,
          touching it.


	* give Items/Spanners access to unbroken originals	

	* generalised scopes for Parser/identifiers.

	* speed up PS code.

	* scoping for properties

	{	c4
		\multi 2  < { \stemup .. } { \stemdown .. } >
		c2 
	}

	this modifies \stem for the c2

	* emacs mudela-mode
	-  should handle block comments too.
	-  handle lexer modes (\header, \melodic, \lyric) etc.
	-  indentation
	-  notenames?
	-  fontlock: \melodic \melodic
 

	* use properties for:
	- Text_style
	- default_octave
	- plet?
	- default_duration?
	- default abbreviation
	- Staff_sym size
	- default tempo.
	- font size
	- bartypes (get rid of derived Span_bar_engravers)
	- cadenza mode? 
	- MIDI instrument
	- staff title

	* page handling:
	- PS output
	- optimal pagebreaking.

	* put errorlevel in Input class

	* AFM for font input?


3RD PARTY BUGS:

	* tried egcs 1.0.2: failed on lily/stem.cc -> flower/include/interval.hh
	  should narrow down and send bug report

	* gcc 2.8.1: see ice and RESIZE_ICE

	* xdvi: PS in magnifying glass.

	* GNU patch 2.1: hardcoded limit of 1024 to the linelength

	* GNU diff 2.7: diff -rN does not see a new directory with empty file

	* GNU patch 2.1: <must find simple example> if patch chokes on a
	  hunk, or on allegedly unsorted hunks in a diff, it may stop 
	  without a trace of failure (create .rej file, print error or 
	  dump core) and just ignore any further diffs.

PROJECTS

IDEAS

	* Output data structures of Mudela in XML/SGML.

	* create libmudela, or liblily_frontend

	* move MIDI stuff (including Quantization) to a ANSI C libmidi library.

	* use an embedded language: Python, Scheme
	for:

		- Complex mudela?

	* y -dims in internote? Staff-space? X-dimensions?

	* Spacing_request for manually adjusting spacing

	* caching breakpoints

	* #c <-> cis

	* breath marks 

	* used fixedpoint arithmetic for min. energy.

	* move towards incremental algorithms.

	* far fetched language ideas
	- design meta-language like TeX and Metafont
	- programming/macros input

	* Global type registration.

		My_class * p = create_object( My_class )
		Type t = get_type ( *p );
		if ( t <= get_type( q ))
			..

	* versioning stuff (cvt mudela, mudela, etc.)


	* dots into separate item.

	* use String iso Text_def for lyrics.

	* Klavarskribo?

	* lyrics in chords still fuck up.

	* pushgroup/popgroup

	* Use hooks/dependency graphs for properties
