This is an assorted collection of stuff that will be done, might be
done, or is an idea that I want to think about

BUGS
	* first clef isn't printed

	* key undo

	* key print if 

SEVERELY LACKING:

	* grace notes

	* dynamics (hairpins) 

INPUTLANGUAGE

	* lose the $ and @ ?

	* figured bass?

	* transposition

	* rest name configurable

SMALLISH PROJECTS

	* read from mmap directly: study yy_scan_buffer

	* binsearch for notenames

	* stafftypes: voice names/ instrument names.

	* Lookup::tex_glissando, Lookup::tex_bracket,  (use texbeam.cc as an
	example.)

	* Decent TeX titledefs (\tempo, \metron, etc. )

	* command priority into enum
	
	* C meter iso 4/4

	* textspanner: center position

	* script-spacing

	* Brackets

	* space rest.

	* use (char *) iso. String for communication between lexer and
	parser.

	* configure idealspacing: arithmetic spacing

	* fix linking: `Warning: size of symbol'

BIGGISH PROJECT

	* merge musical & non-musical column. Scrap Commands in favour
	of Requests, and do multiparallel meters

DOC

	* beam generation.

	* all errors

	* a decent webpage

FUTURE

	* warning: beam(): Beam too narrow: beam gen not per stem

	* put scripts on barcommands 

	* glissando

	* guitar chord

	* better beamslope calculation

	* implement better breaking algorithm

	* Implement all requests

	* merge key{item} & localkey{item}

	* QLP for beams?

	* revise calcideal

	* eentje/tweetje

IDEAS

	* enter Requests directly

	* itemcolumns

	* use an embedded language: scheme, lisp, S-lang, Perl, ?

	* y -dims in internote?

	* hack up mf sources for decent spacing info (and then maybe
	read TFM directly)

	* merge Atom and Symbol?

	* merge Command/Input_command.
	
	* merge common code of Item, Atom/Molecule

	* Spacing_request for manually adjusting spacing

	* Staff_group, Score_request_register.

	* SHIT: meters/bars should be aligned, which is difficult if
	we get different keychanges in different staffs.

	* Integrating (objectiveC) MusicKit with LilyPond
	
	* MusixTeX output possible?

	* PostScript output (esp. Beams, Slurs, etc)

	* caching breakpoints
