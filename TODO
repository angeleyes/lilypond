Features you cannot find in the doco as working, should be mentioned here.
	
This is an assorted collection of stuff that will be done, might be
done, or is an idea that I want to think about

Most of the items are marked in the code as well, with full explanation. 
grep for TODO and ugh/ugr

	* script for unified musicological source: 

		blah blah latex
		\begin{mudela} c4  d4 e4 f4 
		\end{mudela}

	* lyrics with chords broken

	* Redo MIDI output to use Translators
	- remember more horizontal info than melodics:
	- tempo change
	- repeat
	- slurs
	- dynamics etc.

	* pushgroup/popgroup

	* strict separation between visual and auditive processing.

	* fix depcy/dept stuff in eg. Beam.

	* whole head on ledger line

	* piano staff

	* decent spacing
	
	* implement better breaking algorithm

	* update 20 pt table

	* decent TeX page layout

	* enter script priority

	* a Hands on tutorial

PROJECTS

	* grace notes
	- adapt for multiple font sizes.
	- make separate class for Grace_*_engravers 
	(which is at Voice_gravs level)
	- move stem, beam, slur into baseclass to adapt for (fixed
	size) grace notes.

	* accidentals per Voice_group

	* Convert all ref/bib stuff into BibTeX.

	* Output class, handles : (smallish)
	- help text /(c) notice?
	- version line
	- warning /errors/progress
	- abort on error/warning; exit status
	- quiet/ignore-version options
	- logfile output

	* elaborate Staff_side baseclass:
	- scripts
	- text
	- slur start/end

	* Output an output format independent (ofi) typeset file; and 
	  make ofi2 TeX, MusixTex, PostScript, Ascii... interpreters. (difficult)
	- poor man's ascii output possible?
	- MusixTeX output possible? (would have to be done before break calc.)
	- NIFF ?
	- Common Music Notation
	- PostScript output (esp. Beams, Slurs, etc)
	- Move PScore, Items, Spanners etc. into libmutype.a

	* separate Score_elem settings in user-settable (properties
	.. ) and non-user-settable part. Maybe use something like X-resources:
	"Staff=oboe*dir: 0", "Staff=*.Voice_group=solo*dir: 1"

	* TeX spanners , use texbeam.cc as an example (smallish)
	- Glissando
	- trill
	- bracket

	* Rewrite Stem, Beam and Rhythmic_grouping (hairy)
	- [c8. c32 c32]
 	- interbeam height
	- doc on Rhythmic_grouping
	- general shaving on Beam and Stem
	- use plet grouping
	- abbreviations [c2 c2]1/2
	- separate visual from rhythmic info even more
	- beams over bars


	* Redo font support 
	- rename mf fonts to avoid conflicts with musixtex
	- use own fonts/update musixtex fonts/find older (c)-less fonts
	- hack up mf sources for decent spacing info (and then 
	read AFM/TFM directly, for text too)
	- use MF to generate rules.
	- rewrite : make a metafont iso font

	* lines:
	- Ledger lines, should be separate item: Ledger_lines, Ledger_lines
	- set different line sizes / thicknesses
	- stem down too far right
	- beam stem showthrough, inter beam sizes (french vs german style)

	* Collisions
	- bring Collision::do_pre_processing to haircutter
	- left/right note balls should be handled by Collision:
	< \multi 2; { \stem 1; <b c> } { <f as b> } >

	* Keys:
	- merge key{item} & localkey{item}?
	- do conventional keys (C G A, F B E, a e fis, d as des, etc ), 
	  besides lists of flats/sharps, possibly via declaration
	- key transposition. 
	- key undo: \key bes; .. . \key; should print natural	
	- special key: \key 'b bes bis';
	- spacing, national styles?

PARSER
	* Duration -> Musical_duration, typedef Rational Duration?

BUGS

	* fix mysterious Flex malloc bug 

	* should adjust stemlength for flag number.

	* lilypond - -> crash

	* standchen triool beam up/down
	
	* (where are the) gcc compile warnings on linux

	* volta

IDEAS
	* check out CORBA for Score_elems?

	* derive PCol from Score_elem? More in Score_elems? Spacing?

	* scoping in Lexer: do general id- assignments in mudela.

	ID '=' EXPR;

	* create libmudela, or liblily_frontend

	* move MIDI stuff (including Quantization) to a ANSI C libmidi library.

	* use an embedded language: Python
	for: 
		- Score_elems
		- Engraver
		- Translators
		- Complex mudela?

	* y -dims in internote?

	* merge Atom and Symbol?

	* merge common code of Item, Atom/Molecule

	* Spacing_request for manually adjusting spacing

	* caching breakpoints

	* #c <-> cis

	* breath marks 

	* used fixedpoint arithmetic for min. energy.

	* default convert mudela-file.ly -> mudela-file.tex
	  - rename {standchen,scsii-menuetto,...}.tex

	* stack scripts in chords:
	  % fingering:        footing:
	    < a-4 c-2 g-1 >   < c-\ltoe e-\lheel >

	* parameterised scripts for fingering and footing:

            % toe to bheel   four to five
	    %   ^_u            4_5  
	    %     -                           
	    %  --|x--         --|x--
	    %  --|---         --|---
	    %  --|---         --|---
          (where "to" is a tiny bow)

	* move towards incremental algorithms.

	* design meta-language like TeX and Metafont
