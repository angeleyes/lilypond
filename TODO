Features you cannot find in the doco as working, should be mentioned
here.

This is an assorted collection of stuff that will be done, might be
done, or is an idea that I want to think about

Most of the items are marked in the code as well, with full explanation. 
grep for TODO and ugh/ugr/urg

Usually you can get away without having this interlinked structure.
One piece of information you need when exporting objects to scheme is
the smob tag for your class.  You might store this value (a long) into
a class static variable, or a file static variable.  I'll use a class
static variable in this example.

I typically use code that works like this (untested code ahead):

class Foo_class {
    static long *Foo_smob_tag;
    SCM obj; // representation as a scheme object, description comes later
}

// call this once on startup
void init_Foo_class {
    static scm_smobfuns type_rec;

    type_rec.mark = foo_mark;
    type_rec.free = foo_free;
    type_rec.print = foo_display;
    type_rec.equalp = 0;
    Foo_class::Foo_smob_tag = new int(scm_new_smob(type_rec));
}

When you want to export an object to scheme, you put a pointer to the
object itself in the cdr of the cell, and the tag in the car of the
cell.  The code looks like this:

// Is this a Foo?
static int
foo_p(SCM obj)
{
    return(SCM_NIMP(obj) && SCM_CAR(obj) == Foo_class::Foo_smob_tag);
}

// given a Scheme representation, return, a C++ representation
static Foo_class *
foo_unbox(SCM obj)
{
    return((Foo_class*)SCM_CDR(obj));
}

// the SCM representation of the object is stored inside itself
// this will become useful when destructor gets called
static SCM
foo_box(Foo_class *foo)
{
    SCM_DEFER_INTS;
    SCM_NEWCELL(foo->obj);
    SCM_SETCAR(foo->obj, Foo_class::Foo_smob_tag);
    SCM_SETCDR(foo->obj, (SCM)foo);
    SCM_ALLOW_INTS;
    return foo->obj;
}

> C++ determines life time, so what is the strategy?

What happens now when the destructor gets called?  Lets set the cdr to
NULL, and then check for that in all of the primitive functions that
use your smob.  We'll call this notion 'live'; a scheme object is
'live' if the C++ representation still exists, it's dead if the C++
object is gone.  You can still have references to dead objects in
scheme code; it's just an error to use them.  This idea is stolen from
Emacs's handling of buffers ('buffer-live-p' and friends).

Add another function, foo_live_p:

static int
foo_live_p(SCM obj)
{
    return(foo_p(obj) && SCM_CDR(obj) != NULL);
}

In you destructor, you need to do:

~Foo_class()
{
    SCM_CDR(this->obj, NULL);
}

When writing new primitives, now just check foo_live_p().

I hope the above helps,
