	* Register_groups as a baseclass.

	* Junk Staff/Staff_col children.

	* pushgroup, popgroup.

	* basic dynamics

	* MIDI syntax.

	* decent TeX page layout
	
	* < .. > vs. { .. } syntax? ! 

This is an assorted collection of stuff that will be done, might be
done, or is an idea that I want to think about

BUGS
	* key undo

	* key print if clef change.

	* $cis ( | ) cis$

	* Group_feature at start of music. 

	* size of Key_item

SEVERELY LACKING:

	* grace notes

	* dynamics (hairpins) 

INPUTLANGUAGE

	* lose the $ and @ ?

	* figured bass?

	* transposition

	* rest name configurable

	* '*' vs. '/'

SMALLISH PROJECTS

	* parshape

	* bar numbers/repetition marks

	* read from mmap directly: study yy_scan_buffer

	* binsearch/hash for notenames

	* stafftypes: voice names/ instrument names.

	* Lookup::tex_glissando, Lookup::tex_bracket,  (use texbeam.cc as an
	example.)

	* Decent TeX titledefs (\tempo, \metron, etc. )

	* command priority into enum
	
	* C meter iso 4/4

	* textspanner: center position

	* script-spacing

	* Brackets

	* space rest.

	* use (char *) iso. String for communication between lexer and
	parser.

	* configure idealspacing: arithmetic spacing

	* fix linking: `Warning: size of symbol'

	* collision Request_register.

	* LilyPond .rpm and .deb

DOC

	* beam generation.

	* all errors

	* a decent webpage

	* a test suite

FUTURE

	* Register_container baseclass

	* put scripts on bars

	* glissando

	* guitar chord

	* better beamslope calculation

	* implement better breaking algorithm

	* Implement all requests

	* merge key{item} & localkey{item}?

	* QLP for beams?

	* revise calcideal

	* eentje/tweetje

	* piano staff
	
	* abbreviations a4*8

IDEAS

	* enter Requests directly

	* itemcolumns: Use dummy items.

	* use an embedded language: scheme, lisp, S-lang, Perl, ?

	* y -dims in internote?

	* hack up mf sources for decent spacing info (and then maybe
	read TFM directly)

	* merge Atom and Symbol?

	* merge common code of Item, Atom/Molecule

	* Spacing_request for manually adjusting spacing

	* Staff_group, Score_request_register.

	* SHIT: meters/bars should be aligned, which is difficult if
	we get different keychanges in different staffs.

	* Integrating (objectiveC) MusicKit with LilyPond
	
	* MusixTeX output possible?

	* PostScript output (esp. Beams, Slurs, etc)

	* caching breakpoints

	* use exceptions?
