Features you cannot find in the doco as working, should be mentioned here.


This is an assorted collection of stuff that will be done, might be
done, or is an idea that I want to think about

Most of the items are marked in the code as well, with full explanation. 
grep for TODO and ugh/ugr/urg


BUGS:

	* \notes{ a \< b \cr } vs \notes{ a \< b \! }

	* if possible, it might be nice for a warning to appear if someone does
	\translator with no name and without assigning it to an
	identifier.  

	* space after bars?

	* [/3 c8 c16 c c c]/1
  
	* fix singleStaffBracket
  
  	* repeat bars: need distance after ":|" and before "|:"

	* The time signature warnings still remain, will be fixed later.

	Summary of minor spelling irregularities:
	-  capitalization/use of underscores in property names

	* fix Score.skipBars

	* repeat bars: need distance after ":|" and before "|:"

	* \shape 1st dim skipped?

	portato= \script { "portato" 0 -1 0 1 0 }

	* Align_element::padding  ?

	* uniformise property names.

	* strip EXEs before installing

	* zip target for binary windows dist (JBR)

	* text continuations

	* revise documentation

	* abbrev -> tremolo

	* junking \skip req in lyrics

	* Language:
	- \type -> \context ?
	- \translator -> ?
	- fix \partial 
	- \bla {} vs \bla ; 
	- mix engraver hacking with music ?
	- \once\property  KEY = VAL
	- \addtranslator, \removetranslator
	- junk ^ and _ for scripts
	- junk _ for lyrics.
	- abstract grammar.

	* install TeX stuff into tex/generic directory.

	* mi2mu empty staffs.

	* include MIDI list 

	* make GNU style webpages.

	* midi_instrument -> midiInstrument

	* Xdvi zooming ?!
		gs: Error: /undefined in draw_beam
		gs: Operand stack:

	* run texhash after installing .tex

	* fix vertical alignment and stafflines

	* GrandStaff needs more work -- I want a single word
	`harpsichord' to the left of the grandstaff, not one on each
	stave.  (Organ staff -- with separate pedal -- but common
	properties may be something to think about.  Of course for
	organ you want to be able to give stop indications on the way
	through, so the \property Voice.Instrument would be a stop,
	and \property GrandStaff.instrument would be PipeOrgan...)

	* make Tie_req a "command" { <c g> ~ <c g> }

	* bib ep1988

	* revise the Score_priority_align_engraver concept.  It sucks. 

	* ly2xdvi, ly2ps

	* try to use template<Type> iso MACRO(Type)

	- NEWS: ... Musical_pitch (analogous to Duration and Rhythmic_req)
	  think about, analogous to pitch: 
	   * { a4 a16 } c <-- duration of c?
	   * <a4 b8> c <-- duration of c?

	* \tempo 4. = 90;

	* fix audio-items (don't use (input) requests, but copy data)

	* junk My_lily_parser::abbrev_beam_type_i_ 

	* make sure all ex's have a mudela-version

	- make LilyPond RPM fully relocatable

	* nicen examples:
	- break-up heavily-nested score blocks

	* disable spaces in TeX stuff
	
	* handle ^C for tmp/file creation.

	* dots & rest collisions.

	* documentation
	- introduction?
	- info?
	- LaTeX?
	- more manpages?

	* versioning for Feta

	* the warning about the negative slur/tie length appears twice
	which is irritating.

	* The `3' in the meter key is a one or two pixels too thin (at 600dpi)
	in the middle:

	* the bracket is ugly (wings are too parabolic, should be more circular)

	* better hshift (dots, distance, head dependent)

3RD PARTY BUGS:

	* redhat (v?) graphical install bomb-out?

	* GNU diff 2.7: diff -rN does not see a new directory with empty file

	* GNU patch 2.1: <must find simple example> if patch chokes on a
	  hunk, or on allegedly unsorted hunks in a diff, it may stop 
	  without a trace of failure (create .rej file, print error or 
	  dump core) and just ignore any further diffs.

	* glibc 2.0:

	  f = fopen ("/dev/null", "r")
	  assert (feof (f))

3RD PARTY PROJECTS:

	* GNU indent: handle C++

	* GNU patch 
	  - 'double-fix' mode: ignore identical fix, rather than suggest 
	    to revert patch direction when (more or less? exactly) the same 
	    thing is fixed

IDEAS


	* Output data structures of Mudela in XML/SGML.

	* create libmudela, or liblily_frontend

	for: 
		- Score_elems
		- Translators

	* y -dims in internote? Staff-space? X-dimensions?

	* Spacing_request for manually adjusting spacing

	* caching breakpoints

	* breath marks

	- programming/macros input

	* versioning stuff (cvt mudela, mudela, etc.)

	* Klavarskribo?

	* lyrics in chords still fuck up.

	* Use hooks/dependency graphs for properties
