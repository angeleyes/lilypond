This is from the package MusixTeX, version T.59 or T.64 (Taupin
version.)

The documentation states:

	\begin{center}

	Although one of the authors contested that point once the
	common work had begun, \musixtex{} may be freely copied,
	duplicated and used. However, since it is intended to be a
	\ital{freeware} you are not allowed to sell it, and the fee
	you may ask for distributing it must be limited to
	maintenance, support and duplication costs. You may take parts
	of it to include in other packages, but no packages called
	\musixtex{} may be distributed under this name if different
	from the original distribution (except obvious bug corrections
	or text font adaptations for specific implementations).

	\musixtex{} may be included in further commercial packages,
	provided that no fee is charged for \musixtex{} itself.

	\end{center}


A part (the fonts) are included in this package, which is not called
\musixtex, so this not a copyright infringement.
