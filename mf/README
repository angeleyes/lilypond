This is a font of music symbols.  All MF sources are original.  The
symbols are modelled after various editions of music, notably

	- Baerenreiter
	- Hofmeister
	- Breitkopf
	- Durand & C'ie

The best references on Music engraving are [Wanske] and [Ross], some
of their insights have also been used.  Although a matter of taste,
I'd say that Baerenreiter has the finest typography of all.

Traditional engraving uses a set of 9 standardised sizes for Staffs
(running from 0 to 8).  

I tried measuring those (helped by a magnifying glass), and I get the
staffsizes in the following table.  One should note that these are
estimates, so I think there could be a measuring error of ~ .5 pt.
Moreover [Ross] states that not all engravers use exactly those sizes.

Staffsize	Numbers		Name

26.2pt		No. 0
22.6pt		No. 1		Giant/English
21.3pt		No. 2		Giant/English
19.9pt		No. 3		Regular, Ordinary, Common
19.1pt		No. 4		Peter
17.1pt		No. 5		Large middle
15.9pt		No. 6		Small middle
13.7pt		No. 7		Cadenza
11.1pt		No. 8		Pearl


This table is partially taken from [Ross].  Most music is set in No.3,
but the papersizes usually are bigger than standard printer paper
(such as A4).  If you plot these, you'll notice that the sizes (With
exception of 26) almost (but not quite) form a arithmetic progression.

[Ross] states that the dies (the stamps to make the symbols) come in
12 different sizes.
