GNU LilyPond - The GNU Project Music Typesetter


``WHAT IS GNU LilyPond?''

GNU LilyPond is the GNU Project Music typesetter: it reads a music
definition file and outputs formatted sheet music to a TeX file or
(mechanical) performances to MIDI files.


WHY ?

We want to create tools to produce production quality scores and parts
of public domain music.


WHAT'S NEW

* LilyPond now includes a completely rewritten font: the Feta font.
We did our best to copy the best symbol designs available and We're
proud of the result.  We hope you agree, so go check it out!

* More elegant output due to 

	* better spacing
	* better breaking
	* better font design
	* PostScript output for variable symbols.

* Lots of bugfixes

* More robust, flexible, tweakable design

* Better MIDI importing

* Easier to use due to better scripts and input format enhancements.

* MusixTeX not needed anymore
