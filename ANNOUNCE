	Announcing
			
	GNU LilyPond

	The Music Typesetter

Do you pine for the nice days of Linux 0.95, when men were men and
wrote their own applications? Are you without a nice project and just
dying to cut your teeth into a bleeding edge application you can
modify for your needs?  Do you find it frustrating that everything
works in LaTeX?  No more all-nighters to get a nifty program working?
Then this post might be just for you!

I have been working very hard on a music typesetting system (called
GNU LilyPond) the past half year, and I finally think it is ready to be
used and hacked at by a larger public than me and my co-developer.

Sources for this project are on:

	ftp://pcnov095.win.tue.nl/pub/lilypond/

detailed info and examples can be found on the webpage at:

	http://www.stack.nl/~hanwen/lilypond/index.html

(it is somewhat lousy, but I have more important things to do).


[DETAILED DESCRIPTION]

WHAT IS GNU LilyPond

Technically it is a preprocessor which generates TeX
(or LaTeX) output which contains information to typeset a musical
score. Practically it is a typesetter, which only uses TeX as an
output medium. (this is handy because there exist music fonts for TeX)

As a bonus, you can also output a MIDI file of what you typed.

The input is a script file which is read. The script file is a "music
definition", ie, you type the melody as if it is read out loud 

WHAT IS NEEDED?

for compilation you need

	Unix. (windows32 is known to work, too)
	GNU C++ v2.7 or better, with libg++ installed.
	GNU make. 
	Flex (2.5.1 or better). 
	Bison. (1.25 or better)

for running you need

	TeX

FEATURES

ASCII script input (mudela), with identifiers (for music reuse),
customizable notenames

MIDI output lets you check if you have entered the correct notes.
MIDI to Mudela conversion through the mi2mu program.

Multiple staffs in one score. Each staff can have a different meters.
Multiple voices within one staff; beams optionally shared between
voices.  Multiple scores within one input file. Each score is output
to a different file.

Beams, slurs, chords, super/subscripts (accents and text), 
general n-plet (triplet, quadruplets, etc.), lyrics, transposition
dynamics (both absolute and hairpin style) clef changes, meter
changes, cadenza-mode, key changes, repeat bars

[Kudos to the FSF, all Linux hackers, and --of course-- especially
GrandMaster Linus T, for The Kernel and The Announce :-]
