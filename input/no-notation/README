These examples test various non-typesetting things. Since they 
do not generate output, they are not in test/ or regression/

Some (notably parse*.ly) are just error/warning generation tests
and should remain here.

Some (notably midi-*.ly) test midi output, which does not usually
get tested in ../regression files.
