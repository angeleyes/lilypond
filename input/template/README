* Mention this somewhere in documentation (Tutorial)

* Better comment-out most header entries, or
  move to template/title.ly altogether?

* Naming conventions for voices/staves
  (think: \autochange, \partcombine)?

* Add (commented-out) stuff like \time 3/4
  \property Staff.TimeSignature \set #'style = #xxx?

* Handy emacs shortcuts to (these) templates?

* Mutopia headers?

* Another approach would be to not include any music in the templates,
  and standardise the naming of the music, so that you'd do:

    title = 'Piano piece'
    upper = \notes { ... }
    lower = \notes { ... }

    \include "template/piano.ly"

  In this case, we'd also need one simple music example file per
  template.  This approach can be even easier to use, but is not very
  flexible, it only works for simple and uniform pieces.

* Possibly some of you already have created something like this?  I was
  thinking of having templates for:

  single melody  = melody.ly
  melody with lyrics = melody-lyrics.ly 
  melody with lyrics and chords = melody-lyrics-chords.ly
  piano = piano.ly
  piano with several voices = piano-4-voices.ly
  piano with lyrics (between staves) = piano-lyrics.ly
  piano with melody and lyrics = piano-melody-lyrics.ly

TODO (Choral templates, anyone?)
  piano with lyrics and chords
  (string) duet 
  (string) duet parts
  string quartet
  string quintet parts
  orchestral score
  orchestral parts
  choral score
  choral score with piano reduction (i.e., the piano staves have the
          same notes as the choral parts)
  choral score with piano accompaniment
  choral parts
