This directory is for examples of new features in the current
unstable development series.  These snippets will be added to LSR
when it supports a version of LilyPond that includes these features.

When adding a file to this directory, please start the file with

\version "2.x.y"
\header {
  lsrtags = "rhythms,expressive-marks"  % use existing LSR tags other than
%   'docs'; see makelsr.py for the list of tags used to sort snippets.
  texidoc = "This code demonstrates ..."  % this will be formated by Texinfo
  doctitle = "Snippet title"  % please put this at the end so that
    the '% begin verbatim' mark is added correctly by makelsr.py.
}


and name the file snippet-title.ly.
