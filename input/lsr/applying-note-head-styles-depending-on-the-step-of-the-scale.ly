The @code{shapeNoteStyles} property gives you the ability to define
various note head styles for each step of the scale (as defined by the
key signature or the \"tonic\" property). This property requires a set
of symbols, which can be purely arbitrary (geometrical expressions such
as @code{triangle}, @code{cross}, @code{xcircle} etc. are allowed) or
based on old American engraving tradition (you can use some latin note
names as well). That said, if you're trying to imitate old American
song books, you may also want to try LilyPond's predefined note head
styles, through shortcut commands such as @code{\\aikenHeads} or
@code{\\sacredHarpHeads}. This example shows different ways to obtain
shape note heads, and demonstrates the ability to transpose a melody
without losing the correspondence between harmonic functions and note
head styles.
