If you have multiple voices in a single staff and you want a single
ambitus per staff rather than per voice, add the
@code{Ambitus_engraver} to the @code{Staff} context rather than to the
@code{Voice} context.

This example uses one advanced feature,


@code{ \\override Ambitus #'X-offset = #-1.0 }
% begin verbatim


This code moves the ambitus to the left.  The same effect could have
been achieved with @code{extra-offset}, but then the formatting system
would not reserve space for the moved object.
