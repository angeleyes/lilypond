The part combiner tool ( @code{\\partcombine} command ) allows you to
combine different parts on the same staff. Text directions such as
\"solo\" or \"a2\" are added by default; to remove them, simply set the
property @code{printPartCombineTexts} to \"false\". For vocal scores
(hymns), there is no need to add \"solo\"/\"a2\" texts, so they should
be switched off. However, you'd better not use it if there are any
solos, as they won't be indicated. In such cases, you may simply want
to use standard LilyPond polyphony. This snippet presents the three
ways two parts can be printed on a same staff: standard polyphony,
@code{\\partcombine} whitout texts, and @code{\\partcombine} with texts.
