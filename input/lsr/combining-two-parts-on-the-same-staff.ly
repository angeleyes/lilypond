The part combiner tool ( @code{\\partcombine} command ) allows the
combination of several different parts on the same staff.  Text
directions such as \"solo\" or \"a2\" are added by default; to remove
them, simply set the property @code{printPartCombineTexts} to
\"false\". For vocal scores (hymns), there is no need to add
\"solo\"/\"a2\" texts, so they should be switched off.  However, it
might be better not to use it if there are any solos, as they won't be
indicated.  In such cases, standard polyphonic notation may be
preferable.

This snippet presents the three ways two parts can be printed on a same
staff: standard polyphony, @code{\\partcombine} without texts, and
@code{\\partcombine} with texts.
