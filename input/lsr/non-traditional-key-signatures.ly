The commonly used @code{\\key} command sets the @code{keySignature}
property, in the @code{Staff} context. However, non-standard key
signatures can be specified by setting this property directly. The
format of this command is a list: @code{ \\set Staff.keySignature =
#'(((octave . step) . alter) ((octave . step) . alter) ...) } where,
for each element in the list, octave specifies the octave (0 being the
octave from middle C to the B above), step specifies the note within
the octave (0 means C and 6 means B), and alter is ,SHARP ,FLAT
,DOUBLE-SHARP etc. (Note the leading comma.)

However, for each item in the list, you can also use the alternative
format (step . alter), which specifies that the same alteration should
hold in all octaves.


Here is an example of a possible key signature for generating a
whole-tone scale:

\relative c' {
  \set Staff.keySignature =
    #`(((0 .  3) . ,SHARP) ((0 . 5) . ,FLAT) ((0 . 6) . ,FLAT))
