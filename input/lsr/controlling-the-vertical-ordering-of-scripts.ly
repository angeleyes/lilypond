The vertical ordering of scripts is controlled with the
@code{script-priority} property. The lower this number, the closer it
will be put to the note. In this example, the @code{TextScript} (the
sharp symbol) first has the lowest priority, so it is put lowest in the
first example. In the second, the prall trill (the @code{Script}) has
the lowest, so it is on the inside. When two objects have the same
priority, the order in which they are entered determines which one
comes first.
