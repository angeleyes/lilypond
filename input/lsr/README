\version "2.11.51"
This directory contains examples generated automatically from LSR:
http://lsr.dsi.unimi.it/

To update this directory, do at top of the source tree

buildscripts/makelsr.py DIR

where DIR is the directory unpacked from lsr-snippets-doc-DATE tarball
available on http://lsr.dsi.unimi.it/download.

Snippets in input/new may "overwrite" snippets from LSR, e.g. for
snippets that convert-ly can't automatically convert to current ly
syntax; snippets may also be added to input/new to demonstrate new
features in development series.

Any changes made to .ly files will be lost next time makelsr.py is
run.  Please make updates to the LSR database or input/new directly.
You must be an editor to change "approved" snippets in LSR; otherwise
just copy the snippet you want to modify in a new snippet, and tag it
with the "correction-wanted" tag.
