Although the easiest way to add parentheses to a dynamic mark is to use
a @code{\\markup} block, this method has a downside: the created
objects will behave like text markups, and not like dynamics.

However, it is possible to create a similar object using the equivalent
Scheme code (as described in \"Markup programmer interface\"), combined
with the @code{make-dynamic-script} function. This way, the markup will
be regarded as a dynamic, and therefore will remain compatible with
commands such as @code{\\dynamicUp} or @code{\\dynamicDown}.
