Options to group beats within a bar are available through the Scheme
function @code{set-time-signature}, which takes three arguments: the
number of beats, the beat length, and the internal grouping of beats in
the measure.  If the @code{Measure_grouping_engraver} is included, the
function will also create @code{MeasureGrouping} signs.  Such signs
ease reading rhythmically complex modern music.  In the example, the
9/8 measure is subdivided in 2, 2, 2 and 3.  This is passed to
@code{set-time-signature} as the third argument: @code{'(2 2 2 3)}:
