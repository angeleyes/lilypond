When outputting MIDI, the default behavior is for each staff to
represent one MIDI channel, with all the voices on a staff amalgamated.
This minimizes the risk of running out of MIDI channels, since there
are only 16 available per track.

However, by moving the @code{Staff_performer} to the @code{Voice}
context, each voice on a staff can have its own MIDI channel, as is
demonstrated by the following example: despite being on the same staff,
two MIDI channels are created, each with a different
@code{midiInstrument}.
