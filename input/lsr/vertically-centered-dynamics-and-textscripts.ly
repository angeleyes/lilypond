By setting the @code{Y-extent} property to a fixed value, all
@code{DynamicLineSpanner} objects (hairpins and dynamic texts) are
aligned to a common reference point, regardless of their actual extent.
This way, every element will be vertically centered, for a nicer output
(you can compare the first and the second line in this example; the
trick is only applied on the second line).

The same idea is used to align the text scripts along their baseline.
