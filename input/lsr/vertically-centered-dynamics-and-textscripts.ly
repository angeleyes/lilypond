By setting the Y-extent property to a fixed value (here -1.5 . 1.5), we
force LilyPond to align every elements of the DynamicLineSpanner (text
elements and dynamics) to a common reference point, regardless to the
actual extent of these objects. This way, every element will be
vertically centered, for a nicer output (you can compare the first and
the second line in this example; the trick is only applied on the
second line).

The same idea is used to align the text scripts along their baseline.
