This example shows how to specify how long each of the tuplets
contained within the bracket after @code{\\times} should last.  Many
consecutive tuplets can then be contained within a single @code{\\times
@{ ... @}}, thus saving typing.

In the example, two triplets are shown, while @code{\\times} was
entered only once.


For more information about @code{make-moment}, see \"Time
administration\".
