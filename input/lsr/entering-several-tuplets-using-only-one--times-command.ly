The property @code{tupletSpannerDuration} sets how long each of the
tuplets contained within the brackets after @code{\\times} should last.
Many consecutive tuplets can then be placed within a single
@code{\\times} expression, thus saving typing.

In the example, two triplets are shown, while @code{\\times} was
entered only once.


For more information about @code{make-moment}, see \"Time
administration\".
