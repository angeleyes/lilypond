In order to make parts of a crescendo hairpin invisible, the following
method is used: A white rectangle is drawn on top of the respective
part of the crescendo hairpin, making it invisible. The rectangle is
defined as postscript code within a text markup.

In order to fine-tune the position and size of the markup, the number
preceding the \"setgray\" in the postscript definition can be set to a
value <1 making it grey. The two numbes before the \"scale\" in the
postscript code are responsible for the width and height of the
rectangle, the two numbers before the \"translate\" change the x- and
y-origin of the rectangle. 

Make sure to put the Hairpin in a lower layer than the Text Markup to
actually draw the rectangle above the hairpin.
