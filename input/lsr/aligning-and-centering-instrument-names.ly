Instrument names are generally printed at the left side of the staves.
To align the names of several different intruments, you can put them in
a @code{\\markup} block and use one of the following possibilites:

* 
    Right-aligned instrument names: this is the default behavior
  
* 
    Center-aligned instrument names: with the @code{\\hcenter-in #n}
command, you
    can place the instrument names inside a padded box (@code{n} being the
width
    of the box)
  
* 
    Left-aligned instrument names: you have to print the names on top of an
    empty box, using the @code{\\combine} command
    with an @code{\\hspace #n} object.
