By default, the first bar number in a score is suppressed if it is less
than or equal to `1'.  By setting @code{barNumberVisibility} to
@code{all-bar-numbers-visible}, any bar number can be printed for the
first measure and all subsequent measures.  Note that an empty bar line
must be inserted before the first note for this to work.
