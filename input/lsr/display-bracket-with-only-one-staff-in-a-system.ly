If there is only one staff in one of the staff types @code{ChoirStaff},
@code{InnerChoirStaff}, @code{InnerStaffGroup} or @code{StaffGroup},
the bracket and the starting bar line will not be displayed as standard
behavior.  This can be changed by overriding the relevant properties,
as demonstrated in this example.

Note that in some contexts such as @code{PianoStaff} where the systems
begin with a brace instead of a bracket, another property has to be
set, as shown on the second system in the example.
