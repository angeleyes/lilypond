\header { texidoc = "
In early XXth century works, starting with Sch√∂nberg, Berg and Webern
(the \"second\" Viennese school), every pitch in the twelve- note scale
has to be regarded as equal, without any hierarchy such as the
classical (tonal) degrees. Therefore, these composers print one
accidental for each note, even at natural pitches, to emphasize their
new approach to music theory and language. This snippet shows how to
achieve such notation rules with LilyPond.
