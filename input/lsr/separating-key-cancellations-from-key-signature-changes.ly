By default, the accidentals used for key cancellations are placed
adjacent to those for key signature changes.  This behavior can be
changed by overriding the @code{'break-align-orders} property of the
@code{BreakAlignment} grob.


The value of @code{'break-align-orders} is a vector of length 3, with
quoted lists of breakable items as elements.  This example only
modifies the second list, moving @code{key-cancellation} before
@code{staff-bar}; by modifying the second list, break alignment
behavior only changes in the middle of a system, not at the beginning
or the end.
