texidoc = "Concave beams should be horizontal. Informally spoken,
  concave refers to the shape of the notes that are opposite a
  beam. If an up-beam has high notes on its center stems, then we call
  it concave.  This example shows borderline cases. Only the beams
  that are marked `horiz' should be printed horizontally.  "


}


%{
 However, what exactly
it is that makes a beam concave is still unclear.

Beams 1 and 3 should be sloped, 2 and 4 should be horizontal.  Two
sane attempts of calculating concaveness of a beam fail to distinguish
beams this way."
