Beams, stems and noteheads often have communication troubles, since
the two systems for y dimensions (1 unit = staffspace, 1 unit = 1
point) are mixed.

Stems, beams, ties and slurs should behave similarly, when placed
on the middle staff line. Of course stem-direction is down for high
notes, and up for low notes.
