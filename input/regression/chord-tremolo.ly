Chord tremolos look like beams, but are a kind of repeat symbol.
To avoid confusion, chord tremolo beams do not reach the stems, but 
leave a gap.  Chord tremolo beams on half notes are not ambiguous,
as half notes cannot appear in a regular beam, and should reach the 
stems.

(To ensure that the spacing engine is not confused we add some regular notes as well.)
