Notes:

@itemize @bullet
@item If system starts and ends are included, they include extents of the System grob, eg. instrument names.
@item Grace notes  at the end point of the region are not included
@item Regions can span multiple systems. In this case, multiple EPS files are generated.
@end itemize

This file needs to be run separately with @code{-dclip-systems}; the
collated-files.html of the regression test does not adequately show
the results.

The result will be files named
@file{@var{base}-from-@var{start}-to-@var{end}[-@var{count}].eps}.
