When tieing notes with accidentals across a bar boundary, the
accidental must not be drawn on the note in the next bar.  Unless the
tie crosses a line break, in which case the accidental is repeated if
it would be different from an untied note.  The next note of the same
pitch in this next bar should always show the accidental (even if it's
natural).  Slurring a accidentaled note to a natural one across bar
boundaries should be explicit.

Pitches can be verified by printing them  with the @code{NoteNames} context.
