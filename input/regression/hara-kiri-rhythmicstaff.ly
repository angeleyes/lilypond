      " Hara-kiri staves are suppressed if they are empty.  This
example really contains three rhythmic staves, but as it progresses, empty ones
are removed: this example has three staves, but some of them
disappear: note how the 2nd line only has the bar number 2. (That the
bar number is printed might be considered a bug, however, the scenario
of all staves disappearing does not happen in practice.)

Any staff brackets and braces are removed, both in the single staff
and no staff case.
