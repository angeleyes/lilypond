@unnumbered MusicXML regression and coverage test

This document presents proofs for the musicxml2ly script provided with
LilyPond @lilypondversion. The files don't have a description yet, so 
there is no official indication when the output is wrong.
These snippets are provided as unit test files in MusicXML, converted to
a .ly file by musicxml2ly and then processed by lilypond as usual.

If something does not seem wright in the output, it might either be that this
feature has not been implemented, has been wrongly implemented, or a regression
has crept in recently...
This document is intended for finding bugs and for documenting bugfixes.

In the web version of this document, you can click on the file name 
or figure for each example to see the corresponding .ly intermediary file.

TODO: Find a way to add a description to the .ly files for texinfo.
