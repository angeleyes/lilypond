Multiple measure rests do not collide with barlines and clefs.  They
are not expanded when you set @code{Score.skipBars}.  Although the
multi-measure-rest is a Spanner, minimum distances are set to keep it
colliding from barlines. 

Texts may be added to the rests by setting @code{text} in
@code{MultiMeasureRestNumber.}

Rests over measures during longer than 2 wholes use breve rests.
