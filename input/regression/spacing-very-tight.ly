 When tightly spaced, the spaces between elements (hinterfleisch?) 
 may approach zero. In that case, 
 stems may touch the bar lines and opposite stems may touch eachother.
 In these situations,
 a mininum of about a note-width/interline space is needed,
 so that all vertical lines are approximately equally spaced in tightly 
 spaced music.
