If you have a snippet that should be added to the official approved
LSR snippets, please leave it here.  We'll take care of it.

Note that LSR is currently 2.10.  You can add snippets that require 2.11
to this directory, but they will not be added to LSR until it is updated.
The snippets will still be displayed on the LilyPond website.
