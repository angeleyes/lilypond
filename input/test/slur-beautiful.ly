\header { texidoc ="@cindex Slur Beautiful
The curvature of a slur is adjusted to stay away from note heads and 
stems. When the curvature would increase much, the slur is reverted 
to its default shape.  The Slur's property @code{beautiful} (which is 
loosely related to the enclosed area between the slur and the notes)
controls the transition point, and by increasing that value you may
keep slurs more curved.
