\header{ texidoc = "@cindex Tabulature
Tablature is internally done by overriding the note-head formatting function
and let it act on a 6-line staff. A special engraver takes then care of 
choosing the fret and converting the pitch to a number. 

Thus, by providing the fret numbers, the same music can be generated both 
for a normal and tabulature staffs. By default, the fret is the smallest 
possible, according to @code{minimumFret}.
