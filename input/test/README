This directory has a two-fold purpose

* storing big examples referenced from the manual

* temporary storage place for experimental test files.  Over time,
when features become stable, the examples are to be moved in the
manual.


It is NOT a dumping ground for assorted  trick and hacks.

If you have trick that is neat hack, and think it should be in the
manual, then post it to  lilypond-user@gnu.org, noting that you
propose to submit it to the manual.

If you have CVS write access for this directory, then consult Jan &
Han-Wen before adding your file. Files should generally not be added
here but to the manual. If you want to add to the manual it's wise to
check The Documentation Meister (at the moment: Jan & Han-Wen), to be
sure that the example really adds value to the manual.
