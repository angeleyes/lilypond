% Test scm markup text and kerning

% Warning
%  
% This is not a feature, it is a hack.  If you change anything,
% it will probably break (that's because scm markup text is a
% bit broken and needs fixing).  Chances are, it's already
% broken by the time you read this.  Don't complain.

% FIXME: put in an item, and typeset by an engraver.
