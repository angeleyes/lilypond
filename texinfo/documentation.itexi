@node About the Learning Manual
@unnumberedsubsec About the Learning Manual

@cindex Learning Manual

This book explains how to begin learning LilyPond, as well as
explaining some key concepts in easy terms.  You should read these
chapters in a linear fashion.

There is a paragraph @strong{See also} at the end of each section,
which contains cross-references to other sections: you should not
follow these cross-references at first reading; when you have read all
of the Learning Manual, you may want to read some sections again and
follow cross-references for further reading.

@itemize

@item
@item
@rlearning{Tutorial}: gives a gentle introduction to typesetting music.
First time users should start here.

@item
@rlearning{Fundamental concepts}: explains some general concepts about
the LilyPond file format.  If you are not certain where to place a
command, read this chapter!

@item
@rlearning{Tweaking output}: shows how to change the default engraving
that LilyPond produces.

@item
@rlearning{Working on LilyPond projects}: discusses practical uses of
LilyPond and how to avoid some common problems.  Read this before
undertaking large projects!

@end itemize

The Learning Manual also contains appendices which are not part of the
recommended linear reading.  They may be useful for later
viewing:

@itemize

@item
@rlearning{Templates}: shows ready-made templates of LilyPond pieces.
Just cut and paste a template into a file, add notes, and you're
done!

@item
@rlearning{Scheme tutorial}: presents a short introduction to Scheme,
the programming language that music functions use.  This is
material for advanced tweaks; many users never touch Scheme at
all.

@unnumberedsubsec About the Music Glossary

@cindex Music Glossary
@cindex idiom
@cindex jargon
@cindex terminology
@cindex foreign languages
@cindex language

@rglosnamed{Top,Music glossary}
this explains musical terms, and includes translations to various
languages.  If you are not familiar with music notation or music
terminology (especially if you are a non-native English speaker),
it is highly advisable to consult the glossary.


@node About the Notation Reference
@unnumberedsubsec About the Notation Reference

@cindex Notation Reference
@cindex appendices
@cindex reference charts
@cindex charts, reference

This book explains all the LilyPond commands which produce
notation.  It assumes that readers are familiar with the concepts
in the Learning Manual.

@itemize

@item
@ruser{Musical notation}:
discusses topics grouped by notation construct.  This section
gives details about basic notation that will be useful in almost
any notation project.

@item
@ruser{Specialist notation}:
discusses topics grouped by notation construct.  This section
gives details about special notation that will only be useful for
particular instrument (or vocal) groups.

@item
@ruser{General input and output}:
discusses general information about LilyPond input files and
controlling output.

@item
@ruser{Spacing issues}:
discusses issues which affect the global output, such as selecting
paper size or specifying page breaks.

@item
@ruser{Changing defaults}:
explains how to tweak LilyPond to produce exactly the notation you
want.

@item
@ruser{Interfaces for programmers}:
explains how to create music functions with scheme.

@end itemize

The Notation Reference also contains appendices with useful
reference charts.

@itemize

@item
@ruser{Literature list}:
contains a set of useful reference books for those who wish to
know more on notation and engraving.

@item
@ruser{Notation manual tables}:
are a set of tables showing the chord names, MIDI instruments, a
list of color names, and the Feta font.

@item
@ruser{Cheat sheet}:
is a handy reference of the most common LilyPond commands.

@item
@ruser{LilyPond command index}:
an index of all LilyPond @code{\commands}.

@item
@ruser{LilyPond index}:
a complete index.

@node About the Application Usage
@unnumberedsubsec About the Application Usage

@cindex Application Usage
@cindex integrating LilyPond with other programs

This book explains how to execute the programs and how to integrate
LilyPond notation with other programs.

@itemize

@item
@rprogram{Install}:
explains how to install LilyPond, including compilation if
desired.

@item
@rprogram{Setup}:
describes how to configure your computer for optimum LilyPond
usage, such as using special environments for certain text
editors.

@item
@rprogram{Running LilyPond}:
shows how to run LilyPond and its helper programs.  In addition,
this section explains how to upgrade input files from previous
versions of LilyPond.

@item
@rprogram{LilyPond-book}:
explains the details behind creating documents with in-line music
examples, like this manual.

@item
@rprogram{Converting from other formats}:
explains how to run the conversion programs.  These programs are
supplied with the LilyPond package, and convert a variety of music
formats to the @code{.ly} format.

@end itemize


@node About the Snippet List
@unnumberedsubsec About the Snippet List

@cindex snippets
@cindex LSR
@cindex Snippet List
@cindex LilyPond Snippet Repository

@rlsrnamed{Top,LilyPond Snippet List}: this shows a
selected set of LilyPond snippets from the
@uref{http://lsr@/.dsi@/.unimi@/.it,LilyPond Snippet Repository}
(LSR).  All the snippets are in the public domain.

Please note that this document is not an exact subset of LSR.  LSR
is running a stable LilyPond version, so any snippet which
demonstrates new features of a development version must be added
separately.  These are stored in @file{input/new/} in the LilyPond
source tree.

The list of snippets for each subsection of the Notation Reference are
also linked from the @strong{See also} portion.


@node About the Internals Reference
@unnumberedsubsec About the Internals Reference

@cindex Internals Reference

@rinternalsnamed{Top,Internals Reference}: this is a set
of heavily cross linked HTML pages which document the nitty-gritty
details of each and every LilyPond class, object, and function.
It is produced directly from the formatting definitions in the
source code.

Almost all formatting functionality that is used internally is
available directly to the user.  For example, most variables that
control thickness values, distances, etc., can be changed in input
files.  There are a huge number of formatting options, and all of
them are described in this document.  Each section of the Notation
Reference has a @b{See also} subsection, which refers to the
generated documentation.  In the HTML document, these subsections
have clickable links.


@node Other documentation
@unnumberedsubsec Other documentation

There are a number of other sources of information which may be
very valuable.

@ifclear bigpage
@uref{../../topdocs/NEWS.html,News}:

@ifnothtml
News:
@end ifnothtml
this is a summary of important changes
and new features in LilyPond since the previous version.

@item @uref{http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/lilypond-user/, The
lilypond-user mailist archives}: this is a collection of previous
emails sent to the user list.  Many questions have been asked
multiple times; there is a very good chance that if you have a
question, the answer might be found in these archives.

@item @uref{http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/lilypond-devel/, The
lilypond-devel mailist archives}: this is a collection of previous
emails sent to the developer's list.  The discussion here is more
technical; if you have an advanced question about lilypond
internals, the answer might be in these archives.

@item Embedded music fragments: in all HTML documents that have
music fragments embedded, the exact LilyPond input that was used
to produce that image can be viewed by clicking the image.

@item Init files: the location of the documentation files that are
mentioned here can vary from system to system.  On occasion, this
manual refers to initialization and example files.  Throughout this
manual, we refer to input files relative to the top-directory of the
source archive.  For example, @file{input/@/lsr/@/dirname/@/bla@/.ly}
may refer to the file
@file{lilypond@/2.x.y/@/input/@/lsr/@/dirname/@/bla@/.ly}.  On binary
packages for the UNIX platform, the documentation and examples can
typically be found somewhere below
@file{/usr/@/share/@/doc/@/lilypond/}.  Initialization files, for
example @file{scm/@/lily@/.scm}, or @file{ly/@/engraver@/-init@/.ly},
are usually found in the directory @file{/usr/@/share/@/lilypond/}.

maybe some data from

other parts of the docs.  PROTIP: if your faq answers anything
directly, then it means that the rest of your docs suck.
