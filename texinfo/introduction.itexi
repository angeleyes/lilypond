@subheading Our Goal

@imageFloat{flat-design.png,right}

The inspiration for LilyPond came when two musicians became
annoyed with the bland and boring look of computer-printed
sheet music.  All musicians prefer reading beautiful music, so why
couldn't programmers write software to produce better printed
parts?

This software just does that: it prints music in the best
traditions of classical engraving with minimum fuss.  Don't waste
time on tuning spacing, moving around symbols, or shaping slurs.
Impress friends and colleagues with sharp sheet music!

@subheading Why switch to LilyPond?


@subsubheading Excellent classical engraving

@imageFloat{flat-design.png,right}

The point of using LilyPond is to produce elegant sheet music that
is easy to read.  LilyPond's developer community has spent
thousands of hours developing powerful music engraving software
that results in beautifully engraved music.  All of LilyPond's
style settings, font designs and algorithms have been inspired by
the finest hand-engraved music.  LilyPond output has the same
strong, balanced and elegant look as the best-engraved classical
scores


@subsubheading Less fiddling

Spend less time with tweaking the output; LilyPond gets the
formatting correct right from the start.  It determines spacing by
itself, and breaks lines and pages to provide a tight and uniform
layout.  Clashes between lyrics, notes, and chords are resolved
and slurs and beams are sloped, automatically!


@subsubheading Text-based input

LilyPond takes ASCII input, which you can produce in your favorite
text editor, quickly and comfortably.  No more futzing with the
mouse.  The input contains all the information, so there is no
need to remember complex command sequences.  Simply save an input
for later reference.


@subsubheading Mix music and text

@imageFloat{lilypond-book.png,right}

Put fragments of music into texts without cutting and pasting
pictures. Integrate music into LaTeX or HTML seamlessly, or add
music to OpenOffice.org with ooolilypond.



@subsubheading Free software

LilyPond can be downloaded free of charge! Yep - It's free.  Get
it from the download page.

It's also free (as in @qq{speech}) software. It comes with source
code, and permission to change and copy it. So, are you irritated
by a bug, or yearning for a feature? Simply add it yourself, or
pay someone else to do it.


@subsubheading Extensible design

All settings can be changed to suit your personal
typographical taste. If that still is not enough, there is always
the built-in scripting language, a dialect of the powerful
language LISP. Settings, variables and functions are all
documented in the comprehensive program reference manual.


@subsubheading Excellent support

LilyPond runs on all popular platforms: Linux, MacOS X, and
Windows.  LilyPond comes with extensive documetation and hundreds
of example files.  There is an active user community answering
questions on the Lilypond user mailing list, while the development
team makes sure that problems are solved quickly.

@unnumberedsec Examples

Lilypond is a powerful and flexible tool for engraving tasks of
all kinds. Please browse our gallery of examples and be inspired!

@ignore
Here is a passage from Franz Liszt's solo piano transcription
of the Overture to Wagner's @emph{Tannhäuser}. The spacing
in this example was all performed by Lilypond's formatting
algorithms, without tweaks of any kind. It
handles cross-staff beaming gracefully and puts the system brace
perfectly around all three staves.

@subsubheading Vocal Music
Lilypond is excellent for vocal music of all kinds, from sacred
hymns to opera. Here is a medieval motet with slightly unusual
requirements. The tenor voice is written in a different meter
than the others, but must line up as if it were in the same meter.
Lilypond handles this most elegantly. Note also the incipits with
Vaticana style clefs, the slashed stems indicating plicated notes,
and the ligature braces above certain groups of notes.

@subheading What are the benefits to users?

@itemize

@item
No cost: download and try it out!  What do you have to lose?

@item
Sharing: if you like the program, give a copy to your friends,
teachers, students, and colleagues!

@item
Source available: if you are curious about how LilyPond creates
some notation, you can see exactly how it is done.

@item
Extendible: you can add features, fix bugs, and change the
functionality.  If you are not a programmer, you can hire somebody
to do those tasks.

This may not seem appealing to casual musicians, but the ability
to extend software can be highly valuable to serious composers,
companies, and academics.

@item
Future safety: if a commercial company goes bankrupt, what happens
to any electronic music which depends on their products?  This is
not a concern with LilyPond; even if the entire development team
quits (extremely unlikely), the program will still be legally
available for copying, modifications, and distribution.

@subheading Why do LilyPond developers @qq{give away} their work for free?

Most of us view LilyPond development as a hobby or volunteer work.
So this question is really asking @qq{why do people volunteer}?

@itemize

@item
Fun: working towards a goal can be enjoyable, especially when you
work as a team!

@item
Shared goals: we all want beautiful sheet music, but few people
have the expertise (and nobody has the time!), to create a program
which can handle all situations.  By working together -- one
person improves the automatic beaming code, another person
improves the shape of slurs, and a third person writes
documentation explaining how to use these features -- we can
achieve our goal with only a fraction of the individual effort.

@item
@qq{Gift culture}: the Free Software (or @qq{Open Source})
movement has created many great software projects, such as
@uref{http://kernel.org/, GNU/Linux},
@uref{http://www.getfirefox.com/, Mozilla Firefox}, and
@uref{http://www.wesnoth.org/, Battle for Wesnoth}.  Having
benefitted from these projects, some developers want to @qq{give
back} to the community.

@item
Work experience: contributing to open-source projects is a great
way to practice programming, documentation writing, or design.
This experience has helped some developers gain job offers or
scholarships.

@c http://lilypond.org/web/switch/howto

@subheading @qq{Compiling} Music

@imageClickable{nereid-shot-small.png, (click to enlarge),
nereid-shot.png, right}

LilyPond is a @emph{compiled} system: it is run on a text file
containing the notes.  The resulting output is viewed on-screen or
printed.  In some ways, LilyPond is more similar to a programming
language than graphical score editing software.

You do not write music by dragging notes from a graphical toolbar
and placing them on a dynamically refreshing score; you write
music by typing text.  This text is interpreted (or @qq{compiled})
by LilyPond, which produces beautifully engraved sheet music.

People accustomed to graphical user interfaces might need to learn
a new way of working, but the results are definitely worth it!

@warning{We present a quick overview of our text input -- it's not
as complicated as it sounds!  Don't worry about understanding
every detail in these examples; our beginner documentation covers
everything at a much more gradual pace.}


@subsubheading It's as simple as A B C

Notes are encoded with letters and numbers.  Special commands are
entered with backslashes.

@imageFloat{text-input-1-annotate.png,center}
@imageFloat{text-input-1-output.png,center}

Alterations are made with different names: add @code{-is} for
sharp, and @code{-es} for flat (these are Dutch note names, other
languages are available).  LilyPond figures out where to put
accidentals.

@imageFloat{text-input-2-annotate.png,center}
@imageFloat{text-input-2-output.png,center}


@subsubheading Pop music

Put chords and lyrics together to get a lead sheet:

@help{change the lyrics.  svg available}

@imageFloat{text-input-pop-annotate.png,center}
@imageFloat{text-input-pop-output.png,center}



@subsubheading Orchestral parts

The input file contains the notes of piece.  Score and parts can
be made from a single input file.  So, changing a note always
affects both parts and score.  To share the notes, the music is
assigned to a variable:

@imageFloat{text-input-parts-both-annotate.png,center}


This variable is then used in a single part (here transposed, with
condensed multi rests):

@imageFloat{text-input-parts-single-annotate.png,center}
@imageFloat{text-input-parts-single-output.png,center}


The same variable is used in the full score (here in concert
pitch):

@imageFloat{text-input-score-annotate.png,center}
@imageFloat{text-input-score-output.png,center}


@subsubheading Beginner Documentation

We realize that many users find this way of entering music a bit
odd.  For this reason, we have written extensive documentation to
help new users, beginning with @ref{Learning}.

Please read the Learning Manual before complaining about bugs!
New users occasionally believe that LilyPond is not working
correctly, when in fact it is working precisely as designed.

@help{any suggestions for a picture here?}


@subsubheading Easier editing environments

LilyPond is primarily concerned with producing top-quality
engraved sheet music; creating a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
would distract us from this goal.  However, there are other
projects aimed at making it easier to create LilyPond input files.

Some editing environments include syntax highlighting, automatic
command completion, and pre-made templates.  Other programs
actually provide a GUI which allows direct manipulation of a
graphical score.  For more information, see our documentation
about @@ref@{FIXME alternate editing environments@}.

Still not convinced?  Many composers, musicians, and conductors
