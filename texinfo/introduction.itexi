@subheading Why switch to LilyPond?

@subsubheading Text-based input

LilyPond takes ASCII input, which you can produce in your favorite
text editor, quickly and comfortably. No more futzing with the
mouse. The input contains all the information, so there is no need
to remember complex command sequences. Simply save an input for
later reference. 


@subsubheading Excellent classical engraving

@image-right{flat-design}

All style settings, font designs and algorithms have been inspired
by the finest hand-engraved music. LilyPond output has that same
strong and balanced look as a classical score.


@subsubheading No fiddling

Don't waste time with tweaking the output; LilyPond gets the
formatting correct right from the start. It determines spacing by
itself, and breaks lines and pages to provide a tight and uniform
layout. Clashes between lyrics, notes, and chords are resolved and
slurs and beams are sloped, automatically! 


@subsubheading Mix music and text

@image-right{lilypond-book}

Put fragments of music into texts with without cutting and pasting
pictures. Integrate music into LaTeX or HTML seamlessly, or add
music to OpenOffice.org with ooolilypond.


@subsubheading Even better than part extraction!

Parts and score are made from the same source file, so every
change always gets into both score and parts. (demo). In addition,
LilyPond can combine staves in scores and insert cue-notes from
other parts.


@subsubheading Free software

LilyPond can be downloaded free of charge! Yep - It's free.  Get
it from the download page.

It's also free (as in "speech") software. It comes with source
code, and permission to change and copy it. So, are you irritated
by a bug, or yearning for a feature? Simply add it yourself, or
pay someone else to do it.


@subsubheading Extensible design

All settings can be changed to suit your personal
typographical taste. If that still is not enough, there is always
the built-in scripting language, a dialect of the powerful
language LISP. Settings, variables and functions are all
documented in the comprehensive program reference manual.

@subsubheading Excellent support

LilyPond runs on all popular platforms: Linux, MacOS X, and
Windows. LilyPond comes with a 300 page user manual and over 400
example files. There is an active user community answering
questions on the Lilypond user mailing list, while the development
team makes sure that problems are solved quickly.

@subheading Screenshot

LilyPond is a @emph{batch} system: it is run on a text-file
containing the notes.  The resulting output is viewed on-screen or
printed.  A screenshot of practical use might look like

<h2>It's as simple as A B C</h2>

Notes are encoded with letters and numbers.  Special commands are
entered with backslashes.

<p align="center">

  <img src="..//graphics/annotate-example-1"
       alt="annotate-example-1">
  <br>
  <img src="../images/example-1" alt="example-1"> 

<p>
  Alterations are made with different names: add -is for sharp,
and -es
  for flat (these are Dutch note names, other languages are
  available).  LilyPond figures out where to put accidentals.
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="..//graphics/annotate-example-2"
       alt="annotate-example-2">
  <br>
  <img src="../images/example-2" alt="example-2">

</p>

<h2>Pop music</h2>

<p>
 Put chords and lyrics together to get a lead sheet:
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="..//graphics/annotate-example-lead"
       alt="annotate-example-lead">
  <br>
  <img src="../images/example-lead" alt="example-lead">

</p>

<h2>Orchestral parts</h2>

<p>
  <a name="orchestral"></a> The input file contains the notes of
  piece. Score and parts can be made from a single input file. So,
  changing a note always affects both parts and score. To  share
the
  notes, the music is assigned to a variable:
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="..//graphics/annotate-example-parts"
       alt="annotate-example-parts">
  <br>
</p>

<p>
  This variable is then used in a single part (here transposed,
with
  condensed multi rests):
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="..//graphics/annotate-example-single-part"
       alt="annotate-example-single-part">
  <br>
  <img src="../images/example-singlepart"
alt="example-singlepart">
</p>

<p>
  The same variable is used in the full score (here in concert
pitch):

</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="..//graphics/annotate-example-score"
       alt="annotate-example-score">
  <br>
  <img src="../images/example-score" alt="example-score">
</p>
