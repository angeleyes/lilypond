@subheading User Discussions and Help

@subsubheading User mailist

The main place for users to discuss and help each other is the
@uref{http://mail.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/lilypond-user,
lilypond-user@@gnu.org} mailist.  To see what this mailist is
like, read the
@uref{http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/lilypond-user/,
lilypond-user archives}.

You may easily post messages to the mailist with the
@uref{http://post.gmane.org/post.php?group=gmane.comp.gnu.lilypond.general,
lilypond.general gmane interface}.

@warning{When asking questions, please use @ref{Tiny examples}!}

@help{we could add a "subscribe to -user" box here?}


@subsubheading IRC

Some level of support is provided on our IRC channel,

@example
@uref{irc://irc.freenode.net/lilypond, #lilypond@@irc.freenode.net}
@end example

This channel has no public archive, so any question that may
be useful for others would better be posted to one of the mailing lists. 


@subsubheading Other languages

@help{send mailists or forums where non-English discussion occurs.}

@subheading Stay Informed

@subsubheading LilyPond Report

The easiest way to keep touch is by reading our community
newsletter, the @uref{http://news.lilynet.net/, LilyPond Report}.

@subsubheading Releases mailing list

@uref{http://mail.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/info-lilypond,
info-lilypond@@gnu.org}
is a low-volume, read-only list which receives notifications of
new releases.  To see what the mailist is like, browse the
@uref{http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/info-lilypond/,
info-lilypond archive}.

@div-end


@div-class{column-right-bottom}
@subheading Developer Discussion

Most developer discussion takes place on
@uref{http://mail.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/lilypond-devel,
lilypond-devel@@gnu.org}.  Patches should be sent here.  You can
browse the @uref{http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/lilypond-devel/,
lilypond-devel archives}, or send a message directly with the
@uref{http://post.gmane.org/post.php?group=gmane.comp.gnu.lilypond.development,
lilypond.development gmane interface}.

Bug-specific discussion takes place on the
@uref{http://mail.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/bug-lilypond,
bug-lilypond@@gnu.org}.  You can browse the
@uref{http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-lilypond/, bug-lilypond
archives}.

guidelines for @ref{Bug reports}.}

@node Tiny examples
@unnumberedsec Tiny examples

@div-class{column-center-top}
@subheading What are @qq{Tiny examples}?

A tiny example is an example from which nothing can be removed.

These used to be called @qq{minimal examples}.
@div-end

@div-class{column-left-bottom}
@subheading Why create them?

@div-class{keep-bullets}
@itemize

@item
The simpler the example is, the quicker potential helpers can
understand it and help you.

@item
A simple example demonstrates that you have put effort towards
solving the problem yourself.  When people send huge portions of
input, it looks like they don't care how if we help them or not.

@item
Creating a tiny example forces you to understand what is
happening.  Many false problem reports can be avoided by
attempting to create a tiny example; if you cannot replicate a
@qq{bug} in a tiny example, then the problem was probably an
insufficient understanding of LilyPond, not an actual bug!

@end itemize
@div-end

@div-end


@div-class{column-right-bottom}
@subheading How do I create them?

@div-class{keep-bullets}
@itemize

@item
Include the \version number.

@item
Make it small!  Examples about spacing or page layout might
require many bars of music, but most issues can be reproduced
using only a single measure.

@item
When trying to create an example, try commenting out @w{(@code{%}
or @code{%@{ @dots{} %@}})} sections of your file.  If you can
comment something while still demonstrating the main idea, then
remove the commented-material!

@item
Avoid using complicated notes, keys, or time signatures, unless
the bug is about the behavior of those items.

@item
Do not use @code{\override} or @code{\set} commands unless the bug
is about those particular commands.

@end itemize

@node Bug reports
@unnumberedsec Bug reports

@div-class{column-center-top}
@subheading Step 1: Known bugs

If you have input that results in a crash or an erroneous output,
then that is a bug.  There is a list of current bugs on our google
bug tracker,

@example
@uref{http://code.google.com/p/lilypond/issues/list}
@end example

@warning{Please @strong{DO NOT} add bug reports directly to the
bug tracker.  Once an issue has been added to the tracker, feel
free to add more information to that report.}

@div-end


@div-class{column-left-bottom}
@subheading Step 2: Creating a bug report

If you have discovered a bug which is not listed, please help us
by creating a bug report.

@warning{We only accept bug reports in the form of @ref{Tiny
examples}.  We have very limited resources to deal with bug
reports, so any non-minimal example will be rejected.  Almost
every bug can be demonstrated in four notes or less!}

Here is an example of a good bug report:

@example
%% the octavation command doesn't
%% change the output at all!

\version "2.10.0"
\paper@{ ragged-right=##t @}
\relative c''' @{
  c1
  #(set-octavation 1)
  c1
@}
@end example

@div-end

@div-class{column-right-bottom}
@subheading Step 3: Sending a bug report

Once you have verified that the issue is not already known and
created a bug report, please send it to us!

Unfortunately there is a strict @qq{no top-posting} check on the
bug list, which is often incorrectly triggered by lilypond files.
To avoid this, please add

@example
> I'm not top posting.
@end example

@noindent
(you must include the @code{>} ) to the top of your bug report.

@uref{http://post.gmane.org/post.php?group=gmane.comp.gnu.lilypond.bugs,
Post with the gmane lilypond.bugs interface}, or send an email to
@uref{mailto:bug-lilypond@@gnu.prg, bug-lilypond@@gnu.org}.

Once your bug has been sent to the list, our Bug Meister will
examine the report.  He may ask you for more information, or may
add the report to the tracker and let you know what the issue
number is.

You may mark the bug so that you automatically receive emails when
any activity on the bug occurs.  This requires you have a google
account.
