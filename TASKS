Call for Volunteers --  The Mutopia project seeks YOUR help.


WHAT IS MUTOPIA?

Mutopia is an archive of public domain music, free for all to
download, modify and redistribute.  It should be based on free
software. It is similar in spirit to the Gutenberg archive.



WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE

- write legal faq documents

- setup submission guidelines, 

- setup FTP/Web server



WHO DO WE NEED

Volunteers that want to setup, host and maintain a website and FTP
site.

Volunteers to write submission guidelines, and copyright FAQs.



WHO ARE WE?

We are Han-Wen Nienhuys and Jan Nieuwenhuizen.  We are working on the
GNU project music typesetter, a program that does for sheet music what
TeX does for text.  We would like to help start this mutopia project.
Unfortunately, maintaining and extending LilyPond does not leave us
enough time to take up the task of setting up Mutopia
