Like writing music, writing great software needs superior skills, a
dedicated mind and above all a lot of time.  Without your support, we
have to pursue other jobs to feed ourselves and our families, and will
have less time to improve LilyPond.


<p>
So, if you enjoy using LilyPond, <b>help us</b> keep it available
freely by supporting LilyPond financially.

When you download LilyPond, you benefit from what others contributed
earlier.  Similarly, everything that you pay for will be made
available to the user community.  In short, <b>everyone benefits</b>.

Payment helps us <b>help you</b>. Paying will buy our special
attention for your wishes, your problems and your needs. You get
control over our development priorities.
