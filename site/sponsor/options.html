  <h2>LilyPond is mostly a <em>volunteer effort!</em></h2>

  <p>
    From its conception until end 2005, LilyPond has been a 100%
    volunteer effort.  <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~jantien/">Jan</a>
    and <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~hanwen/">Han-Wen</a> have put
    many years of work, along with <a
    href="@DOC@latest/Documentation/topdocs/AUTHORS.html">numerous
    contributors</a>, some of whom have been involved from before the
    very start.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    During 2005 and 2006, features were also added on a commercial
    basis. This led to unprecedented improvements in the <a
    href="@DOC@v2.8/Documentation/topdocs/NEWS.html">2.8</a> and <a
    href="@DOC@v2.10/Documentation/topdocs/NEWS.html">2.10</a>
    versions, and it motivated us to create ready-to-run
    installers for many platforms.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In 2007 we will create a foundation to represent LilyPond. This
    foundation will promote use and development of LilyPond, leaving
    Jan and Han-Wen free to pursue their daytime jobs as software
    engineers.
    
  </p>

  <p>      
Thus, LilyPond is mostly an amateur project, in the best sense of the
word: it is being built with love.  Professionalism is no substitute
for quality, though: quoting Jan

 <blockquote> Lily is by far the most
<em>professional</em> project that I have worked on in my career as a
computer programmer, when judged by scale and quality.
