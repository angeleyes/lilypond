  <h2>LilyPond is still <em>mostly</em> a volunteer effort!</h2>

  <p>
    From its conception until end 2005, LilyPond has been a 100%
    volunteer effort.  At that time, Jan and Han-Wen calculated to
    have invested 9 man-years into developing LilyPond between the two
    of them, since they started in October 1996.  That's not
    calculating the efforts of
    the <a
	   href="@DOC@latest/Documentation/topdocs/AUTHORS.html">numerous
      contributors</a>, some of whom have been involved from before the
    very start.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    During 2005--2006, Han-Wen has been taking and implementing
    sponsored feature requests.  This period has been an
    <a href="@DOC@v2.10/Documentation/topdocs/NEWS.html">enormous</a>
    <a href="http://lilypond.org/vc/gub.darcs">boost</a> for
    LilyPond's growth.  It also showed that it is still too early to
    build a successful company based on developing LilyPond.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thus, LilyPond is mostly an amateur project, in the best sense of
    the word: it is being built with love.
  </p>

</div>

<div style="overflow: auto">

  <h2>LilyPond is still the <em>most</em> professional project!</h2>

  <p>
    As this period of sponsored features comes to an end, the pace of
    development will necessarily slow down.

    Both Han-Wen and Jan have a daytime job as computer programmer.
    Han-Wen's full-time job with Google and Jan's part-time job with
    Atos Origin leaves them one working day a week for LilyPond.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Professionalism is no substitute for quality, though.  Quoting Jan
    <blockquote>
      Lily is by far the most <em>professional</em> project that I
      have seen in my 12 working years as computer programmer, for
      people who like to equate professionalism with quality, that is.
