LilyPond 2.11.10 has further review of the test-suite, performance and
code coverage. This brought to light several problems that were
fixed.  Notably, 2.11.10 fixes lots of regressions in optical
correction spacing and MIDI dynamics.  Also, this version is 20 to 50
% faster than previous 2.11 releases. (<a

Class_name::function_name. We are now using C++ vectors and strings
instead of our own. The Linux/FreeBSD builds now include wrappers for
Python scripts too, so you can run convert-ly and midi2ly.

    LilyPond 2.5.6 was released. This is a "technology preview"
    release, which means that it has all kinds of nifty
    features, but is not actually usable for producing nicely
    printed scores. For this reason, an RPM of this release was
    not produced. The PS backend is now completely switched over
    to Pango/FontConfig: for -f ps, LilyPond only accepts UTF8
    input, all text fonts are loaded through Pango, the TeX
    backend now offloads all metric computations to LaTeX, the
    SVG and GNOME backends are broken, most probably. Download

          brainsurgery in the font handling. As of now, LilyPond loads
          the music fonts in OpenType font format using FreeType.

          LilyPond 2.5.3 was released. A new script, `\espressivo' has
          been added, for a combination of crescendo and decrescendo
          on a single note. In markups, expressions stacked with
          `\column', `\center-align', etc, are not grouped with `< ...
          >' anymore, but with `{ ... }'. LilyPond will now avoid line
          breaks that cause long texts to stick outside of the page
          staff. Grace notes following a main note, used to be entered
          by letting the grace notes follow a skip in a parallel

          LilyPond 2.5.1 is out. This is an experimental release,
          containing some proof-of-concept code for our graphical
          layout editor. You can add and remove things from the file,
          and the tweaks will still work, as long as the tweaked notes
          remain in the place (ie. start at the same time-wise and be
          part of the same context). Further attractions are: the
          gnome backend now also draws beams and slurs, updates to the
          SVG backend, support for the lmodern font set for TeX,

          notes are correctly quoted and formatted when using cue
          notes, Cue notes can now be created with

          Stemlets (short stems over beamed rests) have been added.

          In addition, Jan hacked together some highly experimental
          code where you can use the mouse to drag and drop objects in
          the -f gnome backend. These tweaks can be saved and are

        LilyPond 2.3.16 was released. It fixes a couple of annoying
        bugs, and has an important addition in the slur-formatter. Slurs that
        pass note heads much closer than the average distance get an extra
        penalty. This fixes a lot of difficult slurring cases. See
        input/regression/new-slur for some examples.

        Please consider this release as a 3.0 pre-release so try to find as
        many bugs as possible. A report including a small .ly example 
        can be filed at bug-lilypond@gnu.org

        In this case, a bug is defined as something that the current 2.3 does
        worse than the latest 2.2 release.  We want to be sure that no output
        will get uglier by upgrading to 3.0, so that once 3.0 is out, nothing
        will hold users back in switching. Download it <a

        LilyPond 2.3.15 was released. It fixes for some gaffes with
        the new vertical spacing engine, has lots of documentation
        updates, and has support for landscape output in the direct
        postscript output. Also, the types of events quoted with
        `\quote' can now be tuned with `quotedEventTypes'. By default,
        only notes and rests end up in quotes. Download it <a

        LilyPond 2.3.14 was released and has exciting features!
     LilyPond will try to keep staves at the same distances across a
     page, but it will stretch distances to prevent collisions; key
     signature cancellations are now printed before the bar line;
     different voices that all use "\quote" can now refer to each
     other. Download it <a href="install/#2.3">here</a> and check out

          LilyPond now has a Documentation
          Editor, Graham Percival. From now on, he will oversee that
          useful information flows from the mailiing list into the
          manual. Also, if there are unclear sections in the manual,
          let him know via one of the mailing lists.

          As a start of his career, he worked to transform the
          "Templates" section of the website into a readable and comprehensive
          chapter of the user manual.

          A lot of cheers for Graham!

          LilyPond 2.3.13 was released. The new slur code was
          improved, scripts can be made to avoid slurs, by setting
          inside-slur to #f. It is no longer necessary to instantiate
          "up" and "down" staves separately when using
          \autochange. Jurgen Reuter refreshed the logic around
          mensural flags, so they are adjusted for staff lines once
          again.  Download it <a href="install/#2.3">here</a> and

          LilyPond 2.3.12 is out. This release has a lot of fixes and
          a new feature: there is now support for putting two slurs on

          LilyPond 2.3.10 is out. This release has a major clean-up of the
          input/test/ directory. Many examples have been moved to the regression
          test or manual, and the superfluous or outdated ones have been
          removed. The directory has gone from 146 examples to 72 examples. That
          means that we're halfway cleaning it out.  Incidentally, the manual
          has gone from 200 to 220 pages. New features:
          <ul>
          <li>Running trills now have their own spanner and event. They are
          started and stopped with \startTrillSpan and \stopTrillSpan</li>
          <li>There is a new markup command `\postscript' that takes a string
          that is dumped as verbatim PostScript</li>

          LilyPond 2.3.9 is out.  The important change is that lilypond
          now once-again directly runs the binary. The old wrapper script has
          been renamed to lilypond-latex.py, and should only be used for legacy
          projects. The recommended route is either using lilypond directly
          (with \book, you can have multiple movements within one document), or
          to run lilypond-book with a LaTeX wrapper file.

          This release also fixes a bunch of small errors.  I now consider
          LilyPond feature complete for a 3.0 release.  Next on the TODO list is
          updating the manual, and after that's done we can release 3.0. The
          projected date for this to happen is in about a month.

          Lilypond 2.3.8 fixes a few minor bugs in the new slur code,
          and has rewritten support for ledger lines. Now, in tight
          situations, ledger lines will be shortened so they stay
          separate.  This also required a cleanup of the Ambitus
          implementation. Download it <a href="install/#2.3">here</a>

        LilyPond 2.3.7 was released and has new exciting features!
        The slur formatting has been rewritten. The new slur code
        works similar to the Beam formatter: scores are assigned for
        all esthetic components of a slur. A large number of
        combinations for begin and end points is then tried out.
        Slurs will now also take into account collisions with staff
        lines, scripts (like staccato and accent) and accidentals. In
        the LilyPond emacs mode, the `|' will now display the current
        beat within the measure. Download it <a
