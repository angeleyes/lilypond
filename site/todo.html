&ldquo;... I've written a couple of encore pieces for solo cello which I've

<ul>

<li>
  Time is money. If we get paid, we have more time to spend on
  LilyPond; our ideal is to work on Lily full-time.i
  
<li>
   You pay us money, then we will pay attention to you by packaging
   for <em>your</em> platform, or implementing that feature that
   <em>you</em> so desperately need.
 
<li>Helping us gets you those warm, fuzzy vibes!

<li>We will mention you on our <a href="thanks.html">thank you</a> page

</ul>
