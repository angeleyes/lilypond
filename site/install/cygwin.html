<h1>LilyPond on Cygwin</h1>

<a name="installing"></a>
<h2>Installing</h2>

<img src="@IMAGES@cygwin-shot.png" align="right">

<ul>
  <li>
    Download <tt>setup.exe</tt> by shift-clicking
    <a href="http://cygwin.com/setup.exe">here</a>,
  </li>
  <li>
    For NT, 2000 and XP: become administrator,
  </li>

  <li>
    Run <code>setup.exe</code>,
  </li>

  <li>
    Keep clicking "Next" until...
  </li>

  <li>
    You get to the <strong>Package View</strong> dialogue.  Select
    LilyPond, found in the
    <strong>Publishing</strong> section.
  </li>

  <li>
    LilyPond will now be installed, along with supporting
    programs. The download is 66 MB, and the installation requires 260 MB
    of free disk space.
  </li>

</ul>

<p>
  If you are not 100% sure what <tt>setup.exe</tt> asks, do not change the
  defaults.  <strong>Do not</strong> change the default install
  directory (<code>c:/cygwin</code>), and
  <strong>do not</strong> change the default text type (type UNIX must
  be used).
</p>


<h2>Testing</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    Shift-click <a href="test.ly">here</a> to download a test.
  </li>

  <li>
    Save it on your desktop as <tt>test.ly</tt> (make sure it
    is <strong>not</strong> called
    <tt>test.ly<em>.TXT</em></tt>).
  </li>

  <li>
    Double-click the file.
  </li>
</ul>

This will process the file, and show the result in a PDF viewer.

<h4>Yay, it works!</h4>

<p>
  Good!  Go onto <a href="using.html">Using LilyPond</a>.
</p>

<h4>Umm, I'm not sure what to do. Help me!</h4>

<p>
  For questions and support, send mail to <a
					     href="mailto:lilypond-user@gnu.org">lilypond-user@gnu.org</a>
</p>

<h4>Darn, it doesn't work</h4>

<p>
  Try running <tt>setup.exe</tt> again; this fixes 90% of the problems that are
  reported to us.  Make sure that it has installed the right version of LilyPond;
  if you click twice on the selected package, you will get an older version of
  LilyPond.

<p>
  If it still doesn't work, please send a bugreport.  There
  is a file <tt>test.log</tt> in the same folder with <tt>test.ly</tt>.
  Send this file to <a
		       href="mailto:lilypond-user@gnu.org">lilypond-user@gnu.org</a> with a
  description of your problem.
</p>

<h4>Windows 98</h4>

<p>
  On Windows <strong>95, 98 and ME</strong> there are problems with
  the Cygwin Python package, which <em>may</em> hamper the
  unencumbered operation of LilyPond (see <a
  href="http://www.cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2004-06/msg00956.html">python
  fails testsuite</a>).  LilyPond itself should be usable, but
  clicking on a <tt>.ly</tt> file to produce a PDF, lilypond-book, and
  midi2ly <em>may</em> not work.  Unfortunately, these problems are
  outside control of the LilyPond development team.  Windows NT, 2000
  and XP are not affected.
</p>

<h4>But I have no <tt>test.log</tt></h4>
<p>
  The LilyPond package did not install correctly.  Please go back to
  <a href="#installing">Installing</a> and double-check that you have
  followed the procedure correctly.  If in doubt, send mail to
  <a href="mailto:lilypond-user@gnu.org">lilypond-user@gnu.org</a>
</p>


<h2>Uninstalling</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    By brute force:
    remove <code>C:\CYGWIN</code>.
    <p>
    <em>This also removes your Cygwin <code>/home/</code> directory,
      so
