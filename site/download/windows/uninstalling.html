<h3>Removing LilyPond</h3>

   <p>Start <code>setup.exe</code>, click Next, select "Install from Local
Directory".  Then click next until you reach "Select packages to
install".  Click "View".  Now, for every package, click on the recycle
icon until it says "Uninstall".  Then, click Next.

   <p>(If you find this too tedious, you can also simply remove
<code>c:/cygwin</code>. This also removes the <code>/home/</code> directories under
cygwin (i.e. <code>C:\CYGWIN\HOME</code>, so make sure that you bring
important files in safety first.)
