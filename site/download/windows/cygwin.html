<h3>Windows binary setup</h3>

   <p>The binary LilyPond setup for Windows is in fact a
<a href="http://cygwin.com">Cygwin</a> installation, including the LilyPond
package for Cygwin.

   <p>If you run Windows NT, 2000 or XP, please become administrator first;
installing as an ordinary user does not seem to work on certain
Windows-NT variants.  Download and run
<a href="http://cygwin.com/setup.exe">setup.exe</a>.  You will be asked some
questions.  If you are unsure just click "Next".  Do not change the
default install directory <code>c:/cygwin</code>.  Do not change the default
text type <code>UNIX</code>, i.e., do not use <code>DOS</code> mounts.

   <p>In the Package View dialogue window, click on the Publishing section
to view the available publishing software for Cygwin.  Make sure that
LilyPond is selected.  If this is a new or first installation, click
on <em>Skip</em> to select.

   <p>This installs LilyPond, and Cygwin, GUILE, Python, teTeX (MikTeX is not
supported).  If you already have some of that software under
<code>c:/cygwin</code>, then don't worry: nothing will be installed twice.

<h4>Additional software</h4>

   <p>If you install the Cygwin's XFree86 X11 window system, tetex-x11 and
ghostscript-x11 packages too, you can view the <code>dvi</code> output doing
<code>xdvi test.dvi</code>.

   <p>LilyPond needs a PostScript/PDF viewer to be really useful.  At this
time (Sun Aug 11 2002), such software is not available in Cygwin, so
you must use native Windows software instead.

<dt><code>Ghostview.</code>
     <dd>
You can use GSView-2.6.  This old package has two advantages.  It has
gsview and ghostscript bundeled, and it doesn't popup <em>Register
Now|Cancel</em> windows all the time.

     <p>Install
<a href="ftp://mirror.cs.wisc.edu/pub/mirrors/ghost/aladdin/gs550/gsv27550.exe">GSView-2.7</a>
(GhostView for Windows), or visit
<a href="ftp://mirror.cs.wisc.edu/pub/mirrors/ghost/ghostgum">ftp://mirror.cs.wisc.edu/</a>.

     <p>If you need to view PDFs, or want to create PDFs using GSView, you can
install the newer versions GSView-3.6 and GhostScript-6.50.  You get
annoying <em>Register Now|Cancel</em> popups, though.

     <p>Install
<a href="ftp://mirror.cs.wisc.edu/pub/mirrors/ghost/ghostgum/gsv36w32.exe">GSview-3.6</a>
and
<a href="ftp://mirror.cs.wisc.edu/pub/mirrors/ghost/AFPL/gs650/gs650w32.exe">GhostScript-6.50</a>, or visit the <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/">Ghostview and GSview site</a>.

   <p>Note: <a href="ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/pub/ghost/README">ftp.cs.wisc.edu</a>
has moved the ghostscript/ghostview distribution to a
<a href="ftp://mirror.cs.wisc.edu/pub/mirrors/ghost/">rather unreliable server</a>.
