<h1>Getting started</h1>
<p>
You've installed your shiny new LilyPond, and you can't wait to
typeset music. Here are some hints.

<h2>Testing LilyPond</h2>
<p>
These are the instruction for Unix and Windows on the command-line.
The point &amp; shoot method for Windows is documented <a
href=windows.html>here</a>.

<ul>
<li>Open a terminal window and type

<pre>
     lilypond --help
</pre>
in your window.
You should see something similar to
<pre>
	Usage: lilypond [OPTIONS]... FILE

	Run LilyPond, add titles, generate printable document.

	Options:
	  -d, --dependencies             write Makefile dependencies for every input file
	  -h, --help                     print this help
	      --debug                    print even more output

	      [..]
</pre>     
	<p>

If you see this, you have the program installed, and you can run it.
<li>Start your favorite text editor. 
<li> Enter 
<pre>
     
     \score { \notes { c4-(  c4-) } }
     
</pre>
<li>
 
Save it as <tt>test.ly</tt>.   Exit the editor.


<li> Run 
<pre>
     lilypond test
</pre>

If everything works well, it  should say
<pre>
     DVI output `test.dvi'...
     PS output to `test.ps'...
     PDF output to `test.pdf'...
</pre>


<em>
NOTE: users of LilyPond 1.8 and earlier say: <tt>ly2dvi -p test</tt>
</em>
<li>
View the PDF file. Try these commands 
<pre>
   ggv test.pdf
   gv test.pdf
   kgv test.pdf
   acroread test.pdf
   ghostview test.pdf
</pre>


<li>
The easiest option for  Windows users is the
drag & drop approach, described <a href=windows.html>here</a>.
If you prefer the keyboard, you can try the above procedure, with the
following notes:
<ul>

<li>Open a shell by  double clicking the "Cygwin"
icon

<li> Start a text editor by running <tt>notepad</tt>.  Be sure 
that your files are not saved as <code>test.ly.txt</code>

<li> The PDF file is left in C: -&gt; CYGWIN -&gt; HOME -&gt;
<em>your-user-name</em>.
</ul>

</ul>

<h2>Yay, it works!</h2>
<p>

Good! Then go onto <a href=using.html>Using LilyPond</a>

<h2>Umm, I'm not sure what to do. Help me!</h2>

<h2>Darn, it doesn't work</h2>
<p>

Whoops, something went astray, so you have to send a bugreport. The
directions for bugreports are in the <a
href="../about/faq.html#bugreport">FAQ</a>.  If your download was not
packaged by the LilyPond team, CC your report to the packager listed
in the "Courtesy" column <a href="index.html">on the download page</a>
