<img src=@IMAGES@cygwin-shot.png align=right> 

<ul>
<li>
Download  <tt>setup.exe</tt> by shift-clicking <a
href="http://cygwin.com/setup.exe">here</a>,

<li>For NT, 2000 and XP: become administrator

<li>Run <code>setup.exe</code>.


<li>Keep clicking "Next" until 

<li> in 
 the <b>Package View</b> dialogue, select LilyPond, found in the
<b>Publishing</b> section.


<li> LilyPond will now be installed, along with supporting
programs. The download is 66 MB, and the installation requires 260 MB
of free disk space.


</ul>

If you are not 100% sure of what you're doing, then don't change the
defaults. <B>Don't</b> change the default install directory
(<code>c:/cygwin</code>), and
<b>don't</b> change the default text type (UNIX).


<p>


<h2>2. Testing</h2>

<ul>
<li>
Shift-click <a href="test.ly">here</a> to download a test.

<li>Save it on
your desktop as <tt>test.ly</tt>  (make sure it is <b>not</b> called
<tt>test.ly.TXT</tt>).

<li>Double-click the file.
</ul>

This will process the file, and show the result in a PDF viewer.

<h4>Yay, it works!</h4>
<p>

Good! Then go onto <a href="using.html">Using LilyPond</a>

<h4>Umm, I'm not sure what to do. Help me!</h4>

<p>

For questions and support, send mail to <a
href="mailto:lilypond-user@gnu.org">lilypond-user@gnu.org</a>

<h4>Darn, it doesn't work</h4>
<p>

Whoops, something went astray, so you have to send a bugreport.  There
is a file <tt>test.log</tt> in the same folder with <tt>test.ly</tt>.
Send this file to <a
href="mailto:lilypond-user@gnu.org">lilypond-user@gnu.org</a> with a
description of your problem.

<h4>But I have no <tt>test.log</tt></h4>
<p>
Then you did not install the LilyPond package correctly. Go back to <a
href="#installing">1. Installation</a> and double-check that you've
followed the procedure correctly.  If in doubt, send mail to <a
href="mailto:lilypond-user@gnu.org">lilypond-user@gnu.org</a>

<p>



<h2>3. Uninstalling</h2>

<ul>
<li>
By brute force:
remove <code>C:\CYGWIN</code>.
<em>This also removes your Cygwin <code>/home/</code> directory,
so 
copy important files to somewhere  else first.</em>

<li>
Officially:
<ul>
<li>
   <p>Start <code>setup.exe</code>,
   <li> click Next,
   <li>select <b>Install from
Local Directory</b>.

<li>Then click next until you reach <b>Select
packages to install</b>.

<li>Click <b>View</b>.

<li>
For every package you wish to uninstall,,
click on the recycle icon until it says <b>Uninstall</b>.

<li> click <b>Next</b>.
</ul>

</ul>
