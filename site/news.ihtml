NOTE:

* avoid `HERE' as name for links, use descriptive link names like
  <a href=>Download LilyPond 2.5.16</a>

* avoid putting links in running text. They make text harder to read.
Preferably: (<a href= .. >..</a>, etc. )

* use a descriptive title in <dt>

* Split news items in small chunks. It's OK to have more than 1 item
on one day.

Baca). It also has refactored routines for tie formatting. This will
