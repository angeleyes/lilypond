LilyPond 2.5.13 is available for Fedora Core 3. You need to install
<a
href="http://lilypond.org/download/binaries/Fedora-3/ghostscript-8.15rc2-1.i386.rpm">ESP
Ghostscript 8.15rc2</a>. Unfortunately, this version of Ghostscript
lacks the IJS dynamic library, which means that it will conflict with
the gimp-print package. You may install it with --nodeps. Use at your
own risk.
