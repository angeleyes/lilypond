<title>LilyPond version 2.2 released</title>
<pre>

Dear music enthusiasts,


LilyPond is a program for making beautiful music notation.  It is
free/open source software, and is available for all popular operating
systems. It runs on most Unix flavors --including Linux and MacOS X-- and MS
Windows. Use it for your music too!



LilyPond version 2.2 was released today!

This release has completely revamped support for for orchestral score
formatting, cue notes, font size management, lyric formatting, drum
notation/playback and document integration.

In addition, it has numerous syntax simplifications, proper support
for 8va brackets, and a completely updated manual.

<h2 class="unnumbered">New features in 2.2</h2>

     <ul>
<li>Setting <code>raggedlast = ##t</code> in the <code>\paper</code> block
causes the last line to be set flush-left instead of justified.

     <li>The <code>Timing_engraver</code> now sets the <code>Timing</code> alias on
its containing context automatically.

     <li>The code for font selection has been rewritten. In addition to
existing font selection properties, the property <code>font-encoding</code>
has been added, which makes the switch between normal <code>text</code> and
other encodings like <code>braces</code>, <code>music</code> and <code>math</code>.

     <li>The pmx2ly script has been removed from the distribution.

     <li>Pedal brackets will now run to the last bar of a piece if they are not
explicitly ended.

     <li>Context definitions now use the word <code>\context</code> instead of <code>\translator</code>.

     <li>Property functions may be used as an argument to <code>set!</code>,
for example

     <pre class="example">            (set! (ly:grob-property grob 'beam) ... )
     </pre>

     <li>In anticipation of Emacs 21.4 or 22.1, the info documentation contains
images.

     <li>Cue notes can be quoted directly from the parts that
contain them. This will take into account transposition of source and target
instrument. For example,

     <pre class="verbatim">     
     \addquote clarinet \notes\relative c' {
       \transposition bes
       fis4 fis fis fis
     }
     
     \score {
         \notes \relative c'' {
     	c8 d8 \quote 2 oboe es8 gis  
         }
     }
</pre>

     <li>The transposition of an instrument can be specified using the
<code>\transposition</code> command.  An
E-flat alto saxophone is specified as

     <pre class="example">            \transposition es'
     </pre>

     <li>The naming of exported Scheme functions now follows Scheme conventions. 
Changes be applied to Scheme files with

     <pre class="example">                  convert-ly -e -n --from=2.1.24 --to=2.1.26 *.scm
     </pre>

     <li>Notes can  be excluded from auto-beaming, by  marking them with
<code>\noBeam</code>
     <pre class="example">            c8 c \noBeam c c
     </pre>

     <p class="noindent">will print two separate eighth notes, and two beamed notes.

     <li>Translators and contexts have been split. The result of this
internal cleanup is that <code>Score</code> no longer is the top context;
<code>Score</code> is contained in the <code>Global</code> context. Consequently,
it is possible to tweak <code>Score</code> as follows:

     <pre class="example">            \context Score \with {
              ...
            }
     </pre>

     <li>The number of staff lines  in Tablature notation is now
automatically deduced from the <code>stringTunings</code> property.

     <li>The program reference has been cleaned up and revised.

     <li>The syntax for setting properties has been simplified:
the following table lists the differences:

     <pre class="example">                (old)                           (new)
          
          \property A.B = #C                \set A.B = #C
          \property A.B \unset              \unset A.B
          \property A.B \set #C = #D        \override A.B #C = #D
          \property A.B \override #C = #D   (removed)
          \property A.B \revert #C          \revert A.B #C
     </pre>

     <p>Furthermore, if <code>A</code> is left out, the bottommost context is used
by default.  In other words, it is no longer necessary to explicitly
mention <code>Voice</code>, <code>Lyrics</code> or <code>ChordNames</code>.

     <p>Old:

     <pre class="example">             \property Voice.autoBeaming = ##f
             \property Staff.TimeSignature \set #'style = #'C
     </pre>

     <p>New:

     <pre class="example">             \set autoBeaming = ##f
             \override Staff.TimeSignature #'style = #'C
     </pre>

     <li>Tweaks  made with <code>\override</code> and <code>\revert</code> no longer
hide tweaks at higher context levels.

     <li>Melismata in lyrics are also properly handled  in the MIDI output.

     <li>The lilypond-book script has been rewritten. 
It is shorter, cleaner and faster.  The special construct
<code>mbinclude</code> has been removed, plain <code>@include</code> or
<code>\input</code> can be used now.

     <p>It now supports running convert-ly on the lilypond snippets,
     <pre class="example">              lilypond-book --filter='convert-ly --from=2.0.0' my-book.tely
     </pre>

     <li>The <code>LyricsVoice</code> context has been removed. Lyrics should only
be constructed in <code>Lyrics</code>.

     <li>The <code>Thread</code> context has been removed. Note heads and rests
are now constructed at <code>Voice</code> level.

     <li>Harmonic notes can now be entered as

     <pre class="example">             &lt;c' g''\harmonic&gt;
     </pre>

     <li>Drum notation is now supported  as a regular feature:
percussion may be entered in <code>\drums</code> mode, and printed or
performed in a <code>DrumStaff</code> context:

     <pre class="example">            \score {
              \drums \new DrumStaff { hihat4 cowbell8 }
            }
     </pre>

     <li>The automatic staff changer was internally rewritten. As a
result, the syntax has been simplified as well:

     <pre class="example">            \autochange <var>the-music</var>
     </pre>

     <li>The ergonomic syntax of <code>\markup</code> now has an equivalent in
Scheme. The <code>markup*</code> macro creates such objects; the following
two markup commands are equivalent:
     <pre class="example">           f4^#(markup* #:raise 0.2 #:bold "hi")
           f4^\markup { \raise #0.2 \bold hi  }
     </pre>

     <li>Voice names, for vocal lines, have been added. They are similar
to instrument names.   They can be set by defining <code>vocalName</code>
and <code>vocNam</code>.

     <li>Safe mode has been reinstated for lilypond. 
When lilypond is invoked with <code>--safe-mode</code>, TeX and
PostScript file output is disallowed, and lilypond-bin is invoked with
<code>--safe-mode</code>, the user's Guile expressions are evaluated in a
safe environment and file inclusion is not allowed.

     <p>Warning: this does not protect against denial-of-service attacks using
Guile, TeX or PostScript.

     <p>(This feature is still experimental.)

     <li>There is now a Scheme macro for defining markup
commands. Special mark-up commands can be defined in user-files too.

     <li>Many fixes for dimension scaling have been made,
resulting in correct results for scores that mix staves in different
sizes.

     <li>Improved robustness when  layout properties are accidentally removed.

     <li>A  more cleanly constructed part combiner has been installed. 
It is more robust and less buggy. The part-combiner can be used with
     <pre class="example">            \partcombine <var>mus1</var> <var>mus2</var>
     </pre>

     <p class="noindent">See <span class="file">input/regression/new-part-combine.ly</span> for an example.

     <li>Formatting of rehearsal marks has been improved. The <code>\mark</code>
command now only does automatic incrementing for marks specified as
integer. For example, <code>\mark #1</code> will print an A in the default
style.  See <span class="file">input/regression/rehearsal-mark-letter.ly</span>,
<span class="file">input/regression/rehearsal-mark-number.ly</span>.

     <li>Formatting of ottava brackets has been much improved.

     <li>Objects in the output can now be documented: the following fragment
 boxes the note head, and adds the text &ldquo;heads or tails?&rdquo; three
spaces below the box.

     <pre class="example">                 \context Voice \applyoutput #(add-balloon-text
          				     'NoteHead "heads, or tails?"
          				     '(0 . -3))
          
          
                 c8
     </pre>

     <li>Default staff sizes are now scalable. There are two new mechanisms for
setting staff sizes. Both are demonstrated in this fragment:

     <pre class="example">            #(set-global-staff-size 15)
            \paper {
              #(paper-set-staff-size (* 15 pt))
            }
     </pre>

     <p class="noindent">Both have the same effect on the global layout of a piece. Similarly,
the paper size may be changed as follows

     <pre class="example">            #(set-default-paper-size "a4")
            \paper {
              #(set-paper-size "a4")
            }
     </pre>

     <li>Warnings for bar check errors are more cleverly printed.  This
makes <code>barCheckSynchronize</code> superfluous, so it is now switched
off by default.

     <p>Warning: this will cause problems in scores that use bar checks to
shorten measures.

     <li>The black note head was made a little rounder, which causes a less
 frantic graphic impression.

     <li>A more concise syntax for checking octaves was introduced. A note may
be followed by <code>=</code><var>quotes</var> which indicates what its absolute
octave should be.  In the following example,

     <pre class="example">            \relative c'' { c='' b=' d,='' }
     </pre>

     <p class="noindent">the d will generate a warning, because a d&rdquo; is
expected, but a d' is found. 
<!-- @code adds ` ', very confusing. -->

     <li>There is a new mechanism for putting lyrics to melodies. 
With this mechanism, <code>Lyrics</code> lines can be put melodies
individually, allowing for different melismatic sections in every
<code>Lyrics</code>. See <span class="file">input/regression/lyric-combine-new.ly</span>.

     <li>Bar lines may now be dotted.

     <li>The documentation now has links to a wiki, where everyone can
add personal comments to the manual.

     <li>Contexts may now be changed locally for an isolated music
expression. For example,

     <pre class="example">            \new Voice \with {
               \consists "Pitch_squash_engraver"
            } {
              c'4
            }
     </pre>

     <li>The syntax for changing staffs has changed. The keyword
<code>\change</code> should now be used, e.g.

     <pre class="example">            \change Staff = up
     </pre>

     <li>Features of spanner contexts, like <code>Staff</code>, can now be changed
  using <code>\set</code>, eg.

     <pre class="example">            \new Staff {
                 \override Staff.StaffSymbol #'line-count = #4
                 c'4
            }
     </pre>

     <p class="noindent">puts a quarter note C on a staff with 4 lines.

     <li>Multi measure rests are now truly centered between the
clefs/barlines of the staff, their position is independent of symbols
on the other staffs.

     <li>Collision resolution for dots in chords has been improved greatly.

     <li>Spacing following barlines was improved for widely stretched lines.

     <li>Lyric hyphens and extenders now conform to standard typesetting
practice.

     <li>Lyrics are now aligned under note heads conforming to engraving
standards. The responsible code has been rewritten, and is drastically
simpler from the previous version. To aid this rewrite, the syntactic
function of the extender line ( __ ) has been changed: it is now
attached to the lyric syllable.

     <li>When redefining a context, the associated identifier is also
updated. For example, after reading

     <pre class="example">           \translator {
                  \ScoreContext
                  autoBeaming = ##f
           }
     </pre>

     <p class="noindent">the definition of <code>ScoreContext</code> is updated to include the changed
setting.

     <li>The weight of the stafflines is now heavier at smaller staff sizes. 
The font has been modified to match this look: at smaller sizes, the
font is heavier and the note heads are more rounded.

     <li>Processing scores is now done while parsing the file. New
Scheme functions give more flexibility: for example, it is now possible
interpret a score, collecting synchronized musical events in a list, and
manipulate that information using inline Scheme. For an example, see
<span class="file">input/no-notation/recording.ly</span>.

     <li>Font sizes can now truly be scaled continuously: the  <code>font-size</code>
is similar to the old <code>font-relative-size</code>, but may be set to
fractional values; the closest design size will be scaled to achieve
the desired size. As a side-effect, there are now no longer
limitations in using smaller fonts (eg. grace notes) at small staff
sizes.

     <li>Stem tips are now also engraved with rounded corners.

     <li>The placement of accidentals on chords and ledgered notes is improved.

</ul>
