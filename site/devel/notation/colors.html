Interesting tidbit from the ML:
</p>
<pre>
 &gt; Now, I've a very strange feature request. I would like to have
 &gt; colour support in Lilypond.
</pre>
<p>
That's not at all strange.  Colors have always been used in music notation, for example:
</p>
<ul>
<li> In the middle ages (maybe since 11th century, but I am not really sure), two lines (red and yellow) were used as the only staff lines, indicating "do" and "fa" pitches, respectively. The harp still today uses red color to mark all "C" strings.

</ul>
<ul>
<li> In gregorian chant notation, staff lines were often typeset in red color, while the noteheads itself were typeset in black (for readibility).
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Mozart wrote down some of his horn concerts with colored notes, but probably rather as a joke on the poor guy (a friend of his) that had to perform it directly from the manuscript.
</ul>
<ul>
<li> In contemporary aural scores (e.g. electronic music), colors are often used to distinguish between different sounds, if there is (for readability) only a single staff per line of score.
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Some educational works use different colors for different pitches.  There is even some educational work that tries to teach children a method for absolute hearing by coloring all keys on the piano.
</ul>

<ul>
<li> In liturgical music, the priest's verses are often printed in red, while the community's verses are printed in black.
</ul>
<p>
In other words, I also would like to have color support in lilypond, but I think this is a long-term project, rather than a simple feature.
</p>
