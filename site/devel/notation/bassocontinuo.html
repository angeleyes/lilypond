Hi Han-Wen,
</p>
<p>
Here's  my  personal  knowledge on basso continuo numbering
(I'll  give  you  the historical definition if you desire,
it'd  be  an easy task, but I figured you'd prefer getting
down to the brut interesting facts for Lilypond).
</p>
<p>
Principal  for  numbering bass are the following (this was
the most common method):
</p>
<ul>
<li> The  perfect chord (is that correct in English, its a chord  like  &lt;c  e  g&gt; I think [usually 'perfect triad' in English-raybro]) when unaltered doesn't have any numbering.

</ul>
<ul>
<li> Each number corresponds to an interval beetween a note from  the resulting "chord" (nobody actually does brut chords)  and  the continuo (non-stop stream of notes). Eg: 3 = third, 4 = fourth, etc.
</ul>
<p>
To  simplify things, (this is more for people creating
bass figures), complementary notes do not get numbered
Eg: sixth chord is number 6 (and not 6|3), the seventh
chord is numbered 7 (and not 7|5|3)...
</p>
<p>
[to unsimplify things, for people trying to read or
notate them: In more usual terminology, root
chords (eg, c e g, stacking a major fifth
over a major third) receive no numbers, the written
note indicating the root and the major third and fifth
being assumed; first inversion chords (e g c,
stacking a major sixth over a major third) are notated
with only a 6 under the notated root; second inversion
chords (g c e, stacking a sixth over a fourth) receive
a stack of 4 under 6, lined up under the note that
indicates the root, and third inversion (which
infers a seventh added to the triad which is in the root
location, eg, Bb c e g) is almost never used in common
baroque practice. If it were, it could be 'spelled'
with 2 4, under the notation for the root-position note
(the seventh of the chord). In baroque practice, 7 under
a note means to add the seventh to the top of the major
chord built on the notated root. A "sixth chord" would
be notated with a stack of 3/5/6 (if the fifth were to
be included)It is otherwise identical to the first
inversion. Numbers are stacked by value, lowest to highest.
Additionally, the above examples (on the major chord
ceg) presumes a major key: in a minor key (indicated
by the key signature) c eb g would be indicated by
no numbers, and the numbers would indicate scale degrees,
not necessarily major intervals.

</p>
<ul>
<li> An accidental next to a number affects the interval represented  by  that  number.  When  alone  or  below a number, it affect the third.
</ul>
<p>
[Because the figured bass notations are separate from the staff, it is not uncommon to indicate minor chords with a flat, even in keys where the third's notename would require a natural to make a minor chord. Although this sometimes leads to confusion, it is rare in period sources. -raybro]

</p>
<ul>
<li> A  dashed number means the interval is modified  (this shouldn't be replaced by a sharp or a flat, because it won't act as so. Dashed numbered must be added).
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Some   composers imagined placing a cross (used in the numbering  as  would  be an accidental), to indicate a sensible note.
</ul>
<p>
[note for these last two:
Dashes are sometimes used (especially in theoretical
texts) to indicate that the previous harmony is kept,
even though the bass has changed. Dashes and pluses
may be used to indicate diminished or augmented
intervals. Sometimes crosses ranging from plus-sign
appearance to highly stylized dagger appearance are used
to indicate ornamentation. I have found no indication
that period composers (or modern-ish theorists) find
this wide ambiguity to be any bother at all.

I hope this is all very clear to you, though I doubt it..

I'm not at an advanced enough level to be an thourough reference, in
short, I think this is correct :
</p>
<pre>
    #
</pre>
<p>
is the same as :
</p>
<pre>
    3#
</pre>
<p>
and :

</p>
<pre>
    3+
</pre>
<p>
and :
</p>
<pre>
    3/ (strucked through or dashed)
</pre>

<p>
If I'm not mistaking, which I might, dashing numbers is just another
way to raise an interval.
