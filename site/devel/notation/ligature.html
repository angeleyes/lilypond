<em>Interesting. What is a ligature in music notation?</em>
</p>
<p>
A ligature in music notation is the fusion of at least two notes into a
single typographical symbol by e.g. joining them with additional lines
and/or replacing them with special graphical symbols.  The original idea
was to express that these notes are somehow related.  At a time when
there was no fixed metrum in some music (e.g. gregorian chant), most
(early) ligatures were some sort of hint for the performer to structure
single notes into groups (either rhythmically or for interpretation
purposes).  In modal/mensural notation, ligatures were used to
rhythmically group notes.  In temporary music notation, a very similar
graphical construct is used to notate sounds and clusters that smoothly
change their pitch over time.
</p>
<p>
The use of ligatures imposes some interesting constraints that I am not
sure lilypond currently can handle.  For example, a ligature is a single
typographical element that may neither be broken nor (usually) be
spanned, even if the ligature consists of, lets say, 5 noteheads.  Maybe
the only sensible way to handle these constraints is to model the whole
ligature as a single item with fixed horizontal size.  So, if a user
enters code like e.g. "c \ligature e \ligature d", this should end up in
a single ligature item, whose horizontal size is determined only by the
number of noteheads (in this example 3) and the type of the ligature.
</p>
<p>
Note that there is even a special type of ligature ("pes" or "podatus")
where notes are vertically stacked one upon the other, even though they
are performed sequentially on after the other, beginning with the lowest
one.  I think, the only way to implement this is once again to merge all
the noteheads (usually two) into a single item.

Just another few links to sites related to ligatures (sorry, but most of
the stuff is in German):

  sells true-type fonts (vaticana, hufnagel, medicaea...).  (Actually,
  their "medicaea" font looks like a late edition of medicaea that was
  printed in the 17th century, while lily's medicaea font sticks to the
  early editions).

<p>
For mensural ligatures, you probably have to search for sites about
mensural notation rather than sites about neumes.
