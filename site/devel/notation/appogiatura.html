 The appoggiatura was widely used in 'early music'. Grace notes are a very basic and specific form. Below is the rule, set out by C.P.E. Bach, which covers the majority of occasions when it is required :
<ul>

    <li> the appoggiatura is written symbolically as a small (group of) crotchet(s) or quaver(s), not dashed (except in more modern music -- perhaps since classical era);
    <li> the symbol is ignored when summing the time values in the bar;
    <li> the symbol lies to the left of, and is shown slurred to the principal note (if attached to it. A problem in Lilypond, is that it's impossible to create grace notes that are after note, while this is a fairly recurrent notation);
    <li> the appoggiatura is always played on the beat - the principal follows;
    <li> the duration of the appoggiatura is determined by the note value of the principal note;
    <li> for an undotted principal note, the appoggiatura takes half its value - the principal takes the remainder;
    <li> for a dotted principal note, the appoggiatura takes two thirds its value - the principal takes the remainder;
    <li> the appoggiatura often formalises the practice of 'freely filling-in thirds' in melodic lines;
    <li> the partition rule for appoggiaturas may occasionally change as
    rhythmic or harmonic considerations indicate.
    </ul>
