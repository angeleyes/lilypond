<h4>
 Could you implement feature XXXX? It is really easy, just extend the syntax to allow YYYY!
</h4>

Never hesitate to tell us what kind of feature you need!
<p>
However, inventing a new syntax doesn't explain much to us: "extending the syntax" is usually not where the real problem is. The complicated issue how to adapt the internals to do XXXX. The syntax is really a simple front end to the complicated internals.


<h4> Can I join in on LilyPond development? How do I do this?</h4>

Subscribe to the development MailingLists (lilypond-devel@gnu.org), and inquire. Do keep in touch (through the mailing list) about what you do, as we have rather high standards for code contributions.

<h4> Are there Coding Standards</h4>

Yes, see <a href=../../Developers/codingstandards.html> the standards.</a>

<h4> I implemented XXXX! How do I get you to include it?</h4

Please use the diff command to generate a patch, eg.
<pre>
	diff -u oldfile newfile
</pre>
and don't send complete files, even if the diff is larger than the whole file.
<p>
Don't forget to put your name and e-mail address in the file `Documentation/topdocs/AUTHORS.texi', or you won't get credits :-)
<p>
If you changed more than just one file, making diffs manually can be cumbersome; check out MakingPatches.

<h4>How do I inspect `String's and `SCM' values in GDB?</h4>

Use the following command definitions, which can be put in the file ~/.gdbinit.

  define printstr
      print $arg0.ch_C ()
  end

  define printscm
      call gh_display ($arg0)
      call gh_newline ()
  end
