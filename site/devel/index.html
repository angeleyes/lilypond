<h4> I implemented XXXX! How do I get you to include it?</h4

Please use the diff command to generate a patch, eg.
<pre>
	diff -u oldfile newfile
</pre>
and don't send complete files, even if the diff is larger than the whole file.
<p>
Don't forget to put your name and e-mail address in the file
`Documentation/topdocs/AUTHORS.texi', and add
an entry in the ChangeLog.

<p>
If you changed more than just one file, making diffs manually can be cumbersome; check out MakingPatches.
