<h4><a name="TOC15"></a>Red Hat Linux</h4>

   <p>Red Hat 7.x i386 RPMS are available from
<a href="ftp://ftp.cs.uu.nl/pub/GNU/LilyPond/binaries/">ftp://ftp.cs.uu.nl/pub/GNU/LilyPond/binaries/</a>.  For running on
a Red Hat system you need these packages: guile, tetex, tetex-latex,
tetex-dvips, libstdc++, python, ghostscript.

   <p>You can also compile them yourself.  A spec file is in
<code>make/out/lilypond.redhat.spec</code>. This file is distributed along
with the sources.  You can make the rpm by issuing
<pre>     
             cp lilypond-x.y.z.tar.gz /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES/
             tar xfz lilypond-x.y.z.tar.gz
     	rpm -bb lilypond-x.y.z/make/out/lilypond.redhat.spec
     	rpm -i /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/lilypond-x.y.z
     
     </pre>

   <p>For compilation on a Red Hat system you need these packages, in
addition to the those needed for running: glibc-devel, gcc-c++,
libstdc++-devel, guile-devel, flex, bison, texinfo, groff, mftrace,
netpbm-progs, autotrace, t1utils.
