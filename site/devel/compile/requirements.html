	     <ul>
<li>The GNU c++ compiler (version 2.95.2 or newer).  Check out <a
href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcc/">the gcc site</a>.

     <p>WARNING: if you choose to upgrade to GCC 3.x, enquire if your
distribution supports g++ 3.x and flex.  

     </p><li>Python (version 2.2 or newer). 
Check out <a href="http://www.python.org">the python website</a>.

     <li>GUILE (version 1.6 or newer). 
Check out
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/guile.html">the GUILE webpage</a>.

     <li>GNU Make. 
Check out
<a href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/make/">the GNU make FTP directory</a>.

     <li>Flex (version 2.5.4a or newer). 
Check out <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/flex/">the Flex webpage</a>.

     <p>WARNING: plain Flex 2.5.4(a) generates invalid C++ code.  GCC 3.x
chokes on this.  If you wish to use GCC 3.x, make sure that your
distribution supports g++ 3.x and flex.  For workarounds, see
lexer-gcc-3.0.patch and lexer-gcc-3.1.sh in the source directory.

     </p><li>Bison (version 1.25 or newer). 
Check out <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/">the bison webpage</a>

     <li>teTeX.

     <p>TeX is used as an output backend.

     <p>Also, TeX's libkpathsea is used to find the fonts (<code>.mf</code>,
<code>.afm</code>, <code>.tfm</code>).  Make sure you have tetex 1.0 or newer
(1.0.6 is known to work).  You may need to install a tetex-devel (or
tetex-dev or libkpathsea-dev) package too.

     </p><li>Texinfo (version 4.2 or newer). 
The documentation of lily is written in texinfo.  Check out
<a href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/texinfo/">the texinfo FTP directory</a>.

     <li>The geometry package for LaTeX is needed to use ly2dvi. 
It is available at
<a href="ftp://ftp.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/geometry">the FTP directory for <code>geometry</code></a>. This package is normally included
with the TeX distribution.

     <li>kpathsea, a library for searching (TeX) files.
<code>kpathsea</code> is usually included with your installation of
TeX.  You may need to install a tetex-devel or tetex-dev package
too. If kpathsea is not installed in a directory where the compiler
normally looks, read the hints for Slackware below.

     <p>In the very unlikely case that kpathsea is not available for your
platform (ie, you're not running GNU/Linux, Windows, or any recent
UNIX), you can compile LilyPond without kpathsea support.  In that case,
you'll probably have to indicate where TeX's tfm files live.  Invoke
configure something like:

<blockquote>
<pre>
./configure --without-kpathsea \
  --enable-tfm-path=/usr/share/texmf/fonts/tfm/public/cm/\
  :/usr/share/texmf/fonts/tfm/ams/symbols
</pre>
          </blockquote>

   </ul>


   <h4><a name="TOC8"></a>Running requirements</h4>

   <p>GNU LilyPond does use a lot of resources. For operation you need the
following software

     <ul>
<li>TeX. 
<li>Xdvi and Ghostscript
<li>GUILE 1.6, or newer. 
Check out
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/guile.html">the GUILE webpage</a>
</ul>

   <p>For running LilyPond successfully you have to help TeX and MetaFont find
various files.  The recommended way of doing so is adjusting the
environment variables in the start-up scripts of your shell. Appropriate
Csh and bourne sh scripts are left in
<code>buildscripts/out/lilypond-profile</code> and
<code>buildscripts/out/lilypond-login</code> after compilation.

   <p>LilyPond is a big and slow program.  A fast CPU and plenty of RAM is
recommended for comfortable use.
