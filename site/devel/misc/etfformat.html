<h2>
 An incomplete description of the Enigma Transport Format
</h2>
<p>
Enigma Transport Format (ETF for short) is a format designed by
MakeMusic! inc. (formerly known as Coda Music Technology), and it is
used in the proprietary notation package Finale (Finale is a
registered trademark of MakeMusic! inc.).
</p>

<p>
The ETF specification issued by CODA is available at <a
href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~hanwen/lily-devel/etfspec.pdf">http://www.xs4all.nl/~hanwen/lily-devel/etfspec.pdf</a>.



<p>
Unfortunately many crucial details (which are partly listed here) have
been omitted from the specs by Coda, we will attempt some doco here.
</p>
<p>
ETF is an memory dump where object pointers have been replaced by
object numbers. The numbers are larger than 0 and the number 0 is used
to denote the nil pointer.  The dump is encoded in ASCII (where the
mac version uses CR, and the PC CR/LF as line delimiters)
</p>
<p>
A file is divided into sections like this
</p>
<pre>
     ^section-header
     DATA
     ^section-header
     DATA
</pre>
<pre>
     (etc.)
</pre>

<p>
DATA is stored in the form of tagged lines, where a tagged line looks
like
</p>
<pre>
     ^TG(N1<u>,N2</u>) X1 X2 X3 (etc)
</pre>
<p>
The caret is at the start of the line, &lsquo;TG&rsquo; is a two letter tag, and
N1 (and optionally N2) are numbers identifying the object to be
described. X3, X4 etc contain data in the form of either a signed 16
bit number, or a 32 bit number (in hex, with a $ sign prepended). The
number of Xs per line for a certain tag is constant.
</p>
<p>
The numbers in &lsquo;N1&rsquo; need not be consecutive or ascending, mostly.
</p>
<p>

If an object is too large to fit on a single line (which typically
has only five X's), it is put on multiple lines and padded with zero's,
eg.
</p>
<pre>
     ^GF(1,2) 3 0 1 2 3
     ^GF(1,2) 4 0 0 0 0
</pre>
<pre>
   (the GF object requires 6 16 bit words, hence the 4 padding zeroes).
</pre>
<p>
Note structure:
</p>
<p>
Each staff can contain up to four layers, where a layer correspond
to a horizontal &lsquo;line&rsquo; of notes.  Each layer is broken up into frames,
where each frame is one measure of a layer.
</p>
<pre>

       ^GF(s,m) C FLAGS F1 F2 F3
       ^GF(s,m) F4 0 0 0 0
</pre>
<p>
Here S is the staff number, M the measure number, FLAGS is a 16-bit
bit-vector, and F1 to F4 are frame identifiers. C is a clef-identifier.
</p>
<p>
There is a second variant of the &lsquo;GF&rsquo; tag, which has only one line;
it looks like
</p>
<pre>
       ^GF(s,m) FR C X Y Z
</pre>
<p>
here, &lsquo;fr&rsquo; is a frame number, &lsquo;c&rsquo; the clef number. The function of
x, y , z is unknown.
</p>
<p>

A frame is described by the FR tag
</p>
<pre>
       ^FR(N) N1 N2 0 0
</pre>
<p>
This means frame number N runs from note N1 to note N2 Where
&lsquo;running from&rsquo; is interpreted as "that part of a linked note list that
starts with note N1 and ends with note N2". This is something different
from the sequence of notes N1, N1 + 1 , ... , N2 - 1, N2.
</p>
<p>
Notes (or more accurately chord-notes/rests) are described as
follows:
</p>
<pre>
       ^eE(N) L1 L2 DUR POS $FLAGS EXTFLAGS PITCHCOUNT
          pitchrecords
</pre>
<p>

This is note number N (in list where L1 and L2 are previous and
next).
</p>
<p>
Durations are stored as a number where 1024 is the quarter note, 512
the eighth, etc. Dotted notes are stored by multiplying the dur field
appropriately.
</p>
<p>
pitchcount is the number of pitch records. Each pitchrecord looks
like
</p>
<pre>
             pitch $flags
   (note that the line starts with spaces, and not with  a caret)
</pre>
<p>
pitch is a 16 bit number, where the lower order 4-bits is a signed
nybble which adds an alteration (0 = natural,  1 = sharp, etc.)  The
remaining 12 bits encodes the note-name (octave inclusive.)
</p>
<p>
Both the alteration and the note-name are relative to the scale as
defined by the key-signature in this measure.  The person who invented
this should have his head checked out.

</p>
<p>
The key and time signature are defined in the MS field. The
measure struct is  documented in the SDK file edata.h
</p>
<pre>
       ^MS(n) space key beats beatlen y z
</pre>
<p>
N is the measure number.  SPACE is the width of the measure (?), KEY
the number of the keysignature (0 = C major, 1 G major, etc. 255 = F
major, 254 = Bflat major). beats and beatlen determine time signature.
Y and Z are two 16bit bit-fields. The bits are documented in the SDK.
</p>
<p>
Key and time are determined score wide. The mind boggles at how they
plan to do polytonal and polymetric music. And how do they do
mid-measure keychanges?
</p>
<p>
Slurs are (among others) stored with an Sx tag
</p>

<pre>
       ^Sx(SLURNUMBER) STUFF
</pre>
<p>
The slur has many parameters. The 6th number on the first line is the
starting note, the 3rd number on the 4th line the ending note.
</p>
<p>
Articulation is stored in a two-step process: for every articulation there is an
</p>
<pre>
	IM(n,m)  def h1 h2 v1 v2
</pre>
<p>
H1, H2, V1 and V2 are offsets. DEF is the number of an articulation definition.
M is the note number.
</p>

<p>
The articulation definition looks like
</p>
<pre>
	IX(n)  ... [24 16-bit words] ..
</pre>
<p>
the layout is described in edata.h. The first two words contain info  on the glyph.
</p>
