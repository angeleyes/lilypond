<p>
If you have input that results in a crash or an erroneous output, then
that is a bug.  There is a list of current bugs on our google bug
tracker,

<blockquote>
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/lilypond/issues/list">
http://code.google.com/p/lilypond/issues/list</a>
</blockquote>

If you have discovered a bug which is not listed, please help us by
sending an input file which demonstrates the problem to the
<a href="http://post.gmane.org/post.php?group=gmane.comp.gnu.lilypond.bugs">
bug-lilypond</a> list.  Do not add bug reports directly to the bug
tracker.  Unfortunately there is a strict
&ldquo;no top-posting&rdquo; check; to avoid this, add
<pre>
> I'm not top posting.
</pre>
(you must include the <tt>></tt> ) to the top of your bug report.


<br>
<br>
<p>
When creating a file, please

<ul>
<li>Include the <tt>\version</tt> number.

<li>Create an example which is as small as possible.  Most bugs can
be duplicated in less than ten lines of LilyPond code.  Unfortunately
we do not have the resources to debug large examples.

<li>Do not use <tt>\override</tt> commands unless the bug is
about those particular commands.

<li>Avoid using complicated notes, keys, or time signatures, unless
the bug is about the behavior of those items.

<li>If possible, use <tt>\paper{ ragged-right=##t }</tt> at the top
of your example.
</ul>

Here's an example of a good bug report:

<pre>
%% the octavation command doesn't do anything.

\version "2.10.0"
\paper{ ragged-right=##t }
\relative c''' {
  c1
  #(set-octavation 1)
  c1
}
</pre>




<p>
Once your bug has been accepted to the bug tracker, you may mark the
bug so that you automatically receive emails when any activity on the
bug occurs.  Unfortunately this requires a google account.
