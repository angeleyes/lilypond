<h1>Bug reporting</h1>

<p>
If you have input that results in a crash or an erroneous output, then
that is a bug.  There is a list of current bugs on our google bug
tracker,

<blockquote>
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/lilypond/issues/list">
http://code.google.com/p/lilypond/issues/list</a>
</blockquote>

If you have discovered a bug which is not listed, please help us by
sending an input file which demonstrates the problem.

<p>
When creating a file, please

<ul>
<li>Include the <tt>\version</tt> number and which Operating System
you use.

<li>Create an example which is as small as possible.  Most bugs can
be duplicated in less than ten lines of LilyPond code.  Unfortunately
we do not have the resources to debug large examples.

<li>If possible, use <tt>\paper{ ragged-right=##t }</tt> at the top
of your example.
</ul>

Here's an example of a good bug report:

<pre>
%% the octovation command doesn't do anything.

\version "2.10.0"  % on OSX
\paper{ ragged-right=##t }
\relative c''' {
  c1
  #(set-octavation 1)
  c1
}
</pre>
