<h1> Localization guidelines</h1>

This document provides some guidelines
To help translations, user messages must be uniformized.
Follow these rules when coding for LilyPond.

Hopefully, this can be replaced by general GNU guidelines in the
future.
</p>
<p>
Not-preferred messages are marked with `+'.  By convention,
ungrammatical examples are marked with `*'.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Every message to the user should be localised (and thus be marked
for localisation).  This includes warning and error messages.

<li> Don't localise/gettextify:
<p>
- `programming_error ()'s
</p>
<p>
- `programming_warning ()'s
</p>
<p>
- debug strings
</p>
<p>
- output strings (PostScript, TeX, etc.)

</p>
<li> Messages to be localised must be encapsulated in `_ (STRING)' or
`_f (FORMAT, ...)'.  Eg:
</p>
<pre>
          warning (_ ("Need music in a score"));
          error (_f ("Can't open file: `%s'", file_name));
</pre>
<p>
In some rare cases you may need to call `gettext ()' by hand.
This happens when you pre-define (a list of) string constants for
later use.  In that case, you'll probably also need to mark these
string constants for translation, using `_i (STRING)'.  The `_i'
macro is a no-op, it only serves as a marker for `xgettext'.
</p>
<pre>
          char const* messages[] = {
            _i ("enable debugging output"),
            _i ("ignore lilypond version"),
            0
          };

</pre>
<pre>
          void
          foo (int i)
          {
            puts (gettext (messages <u>i</u>));
          }
</pre>
<p>
See also `flower/getopt-long.cc' and `lily/main.cc'.
</p>
<li> Don't use leading or trailing whitespace in messages.
<li> Messages containing a final verb, or a gerund (`-ing'-form) always

start with a capital.  Other (simpler) messages start with a
lowercase letter:
</p>
<pre>
          The word `foo' is not declared.
          `foo': not declared.
          Not declaring: `foo'.
</pre>
<li> To avoid having a number of different messages for the same
situation, we'll use quoting like this `"message: `%s'"' for all
strings.  Numbers are not quoted:
</p>
<pre>
          _f ("Can't open file: `%s'", name_str)
          _f ("Can't find charater number: %d", i)

</pre>
<li> Think about translation issues.  In a lot of cases, it is better to
translate a whole message.  The english grammar mustn't be imposed
on the translator.  So, instead of
</p>
<pre>
          _ ("Stem at ") + moment.str () + _(" doesn't fit in beam")
</pre>
<p>
have
</p>
<pre>
          _f ("Stem at %s doen't fit in beam", moment.str ())

</pre>
<li> Split up multi-sentence messages, whenever possible.  Instead of
<pre>
          warning (_f ("out of tune!  Can't find: `%s', "Key_engraver"));
          warning (_f ("Can't find font `%s', loading default",
                       font_name));
</pre>
<p>
rather say:
</p>
<pre>

          warning (_ ("out of tune:");
          warning (_f ("Can't find: `%s', "Key_engraver"));
          warning (_f ("Can't find font: `%s', font_name));
          warning (_f ("Loading default font"));
</pre>
<li> If you must have multiple-sentence messages, use full punctuation.
<p>
Use two spaces after end of sentence punctuation.  No punctuation
(esp. period) is used at the end of simple messages.
</p>
<pre>
             _f ("Non-matching braces in text `%s', adding braces", text)
             _ ("Debug output disabled.  Compiled with NPRINT.")
             _f ("Huh?  Not a Request: `%s'.  Ignoring.", request)

</pre>
<li> Don't modularise too much; a lot of words cannot be translated
without context.  It's probably safe to treat most occurences of
words like stem, beam, crescendo as separately translatable words.
</p>
<li> When translating, it is preferable to put interesting information
at the end of the message, rather than embedded in the middle.
This especially applies to frequently used messages, even if this
would mean sacrificing a bit of eloquency.  This holds for original
messages too, of course.
</p>
<pre>
              en: can't open: `foo.ly'
          +   nl: kan `foo.ly' niet openen (1)
              kan niet openen: `foo.ly'*   (2)
              niet te openen: `foo.ly'*    (3)

</pre>
<p>
The first nl message, although grammatically and stylistically correct,
is not friendly for parsing by humans (even if they speak dutch).
I guess we'd prefer something like (2) or (3).
</p>
<li> Please don't run make po/po-update with GNU gettext &lt; 0.10.35

</ul>
