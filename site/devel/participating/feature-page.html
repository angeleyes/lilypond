The lilypond website does a nice job of giving an idea of LilyPond's
capabilities. Unfortunately, it is hard to explain some of the more
advanced features in just a few words. For example, LilyPond does not
have part extraction, but rather a much more powerful mechanism:
part-combining and automatic cue notes.

<p>
 What we really need is a separate page documenting this feature, with
a few short examples and/or screenshots. The page should be
<ul>
<li> attractive
<li> understandable for non-LilyPond users
<li> explain the benefits and advantages of this feature
<li> point into the documentation
<li> if applicable, give some advanced tips 
</ul>

<p>
The mozilla.org pages about <a
href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/live-bookmarks.html">
Live bookmarks</a> and <a
href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/tabbed-browsing.html">
tabbed browsing</a> are examples what we want.
