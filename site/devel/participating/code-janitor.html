The

CODE JANITOR
</h1>
makes sure that new C++ and Scheme code follows the standards.
<p>
Writing LilyPond code is an intensive --and sometimes frantic--
process, and the code that is written in deep-hack mode often is
unpolished.  The janitor helps by adding the polish, and standardizing
the code
<ul>
 <li>Cleanup code spacing, formatting, indenting, file names, etc.

 <li>Standardize
   <ul>
   <li>error messages
   <li>doc strings
   <li>texidoc strings
   <li>function comments
   <li>debugging code
   </ul>
   
 <li>Submit pot files to the translation robot, and update the
    translations in CVS.

 <li>Define new coding style standards, where necessary.
 </ul>
