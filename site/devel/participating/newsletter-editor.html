<h1>NEWSLETTER EDITOR</h1>


The LilyPond community is centered around the lilypond-user mailing
list, which is becoming rather high-traffic nowadays; even we have
trouble keeping up with it ourselves.  We think it would be a boon to
have a
<p>
<b>NEWSLETTER EDITOR</b>
<p>
who summarizes the hot topics on lilypond-user and lilypond-devel.  We
was thinking along the lines of the "Kernel traffic" newsletter (<a
href="http://www.kerneltraffic.org/index.html">http://www.kerneltraffic.org/index.html</a>).
Hopefully, this will make lurking on the list easier, and help build a
wider community of LilyPond followers.
