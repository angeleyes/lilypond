<h1>RELEASE-MEISTER</h1>

The job of the release-meister is to build, troubleshoot and
upload  releases.

<p>
LilyPond is ready for a release when:


<ul>

 <li>The regression test comes out clean

 <li>All features work as documented 

 <li>A new release offers an improvement over the last one

 </ul>

The release-meister keeps an eye on the bug tracker and the current
head to determine when a release should be made.
<p>
The actual mechanics of building a release is completely scripted
in our <a href="http://lilypond.org/vc/gub.darcs/READ-ME">Grand
Unified Builder</a> system.
