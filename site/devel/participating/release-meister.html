<h1>RELEASE-MEISTER</h1>

The job of the release-meister is to coordinate releases.  Ideally,
they would happen less frequently than they do now --perhaps once a
month-- but offer a better quality.
<p>
LilyPond is ready for a release when
<ul>

 <li>The regression test comes out clean

 <li>All features work as documented 

 <li>A new release would offer an improvement over the last one
</ul>

The release-meister keeps an eye on the bugreports and ChangeLog, and
has the responsibility to decide when a release is in order.
<p>
The actual mechanics entail branching CVS, pestering developers for
important bug-fixes, creating and uploading the tarball, announcing it
on mailing lists, websites, etc.
