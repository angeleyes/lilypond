<h1>BUG MEISTER</h1>

The Bug-meister is the human face behind the collection of LilyPond
bugs.  He (or she, of course) keeps an eye on bugs in LilyPond,
especially those where LilyPond produces incorrect notation or
typography.  This is a very important job, since good responses to
bugreports makes LilyPond look good for struggling users.

<ul>
 <li>He'll be reading the bug-lilypond and lilypond-user mailing
    list, replying to bugreporters and distilling small failure cases
    for each report.

 <li>Every bug goes into the <a
    href="http://code.google.com/p/lilypond/issues/list">bug-collection</a>.
    In the collection for each bug, there is



    <ul>

     <li>A .ly snippet, trimmed as far as possible.

    <li>An image demonstrating the problem.

    <li>A description of what is wrong.

    <li>Whether the bug concerns a new feature, or breaks existing
       features.

    <li>If the latter, the version number where the bug started
       manifesting.

    <li>The severity of the bug: a bug should get priority if it causes
       crashes, when there are no workarounds, or if it affects a large
       number of people.
  </ul>

  <li> After the developers claim to have fixed a bug, the bug-meister
  verifies this. 
 
</ul>
