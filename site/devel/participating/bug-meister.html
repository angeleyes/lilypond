<h1>BUG MEISTER</h1>

The Bug-meister is the human face behind the collection of LilyPond
bugs.  He (or she, of course) keeps an eye on bugs in LilyPond,
especially those where LilyPond produces incorrect notation or
typography.  This is a very important job, since good responses to
bugreports makes LilyPond look good for struggling users.
<ul>
 <li>He will be reading the bug-lilypond and lilypond-user mailing
    list, replying to bugreporters and distilling small failure cases
    for each report.

 <li>Every bug goes into a bug-collection.  In the collection for each
    bug, there is
<ul>
    <li>A .ly snippet, trimmed as far as possible.

    <li>An image demonstrating the problem.

    <li>A description of what is wrong.

    <li>Whether the bug concerns a new feature, or breaks existing
       features.

    <li>If the latter, the version number where the bug started
       manifesting.

    <li>The severity of the bug: a bug should get priority if it causes
       crashes, when there are no workarounds, or if it affects a large
       number of people.
</ul>
 <li>Periodically (say, every week), the bug-collection is run through
    LilyPond to determine which problems are still open.

 <li>Some bugs, when fixed, should be added as a regression test.

 <li>Of course, the bug-meister will pester developers to fix serious
    bugs.
</ul>

An example of excellent bug-reports is the bug-collection of Werner
Lemberg, see for example
