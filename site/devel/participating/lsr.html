<h1>LilyPond Snippet Repository</h1>

<p>
The LilyPond Snippet Repository (affectionately known as LSR) is a
collection of small examples.  It can be easily searched for special
tricks, or simply browsed to see some neat examples.  You can also
add your own examples, so that other LilyPond users can benefit from
your knowledge.  Visit the <a href="http://lsr.dsi.unimi.it/">LSR</a>
and see for yourself!
