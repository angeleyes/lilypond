<h3>Dear LilyPond afficionado,</h3>
<p>
As you might have noticed, LilyPond has been improving at a breakneck
speed for the last year, which is a good thing.  This email hopes to
continue that trend by unleashing an enormous source of development
potential, and that is ...
<blockquote>
	You!
</blockquote>

LilyPond already has seen an increase contributions over the past
months, from packagers, bugfixers, proofreaders, etc.  We love your
help, and we can't have enough of it so we are seeking help.  Join
LilyPond development for riches, eternal fame, and getting your name
in the THANKS file :-)
<p>

There are plenty of ways to get into the THANKS file, for example, by
taking care of documentation, bug reports, releases, etc.  We have
compiled a list of tasks that we would love to be helped with.  Have a
look to see if there is something for you!
<p>

Many of the tasks are not very technical, so don't dismiss yourself
too quickly.  We have plenty of experience with these tasks, so there
is always someone to guide you and get you started.
<p>

Hopefully, together we can address problems in the LilyPond
development process, among others
<ul>
<li> Stable releases don't happen often enough.
<li> Development is too much centralized.
<li> The learning curve is too steep.
</ul>

The list of tasks is not exhaustive.  If you have good ideas on how to
get more people involved, or how to use our energy more efficiently,
don't hesitate to drop a note on the development mailing list
<pre>
	lilypond-devel@gnu.org

Of course, if you have an itch to scratch, you can also send patches
to this mailinglist :-)
<p>

<h3>What other great plans can you expect from us?</h3>


We have a roadmap, sort of, which is to implement the following
features for the next major release
<ul>
<li> Support for font-encoding like latin1, cyrillic, etc.
<li> Usable direct postscript output (with titling, and multiple scores).
<li> Optimal page breaking.
</ul>

Of course, the release date depends on how much help we get with all
the tasks mentioned below.
