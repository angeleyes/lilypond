CodingStandards
<p>
   As a general rule, you should always try to continue computations,
   even if there is some kind of error. When the program stops, it is
   often very hard for a user to pinpoint what part of the input causes an
   error. Finding the culprit is much easier if there is some viewable
   output.
<p>

   So functions and methods do not return errorcodes, they never crash,
   but report a programming_error and try to carry on.
<p>

Languages
<p>

   C++ and Python are preferred.  Python code should be idented using
   using TAB characters.
<p>

Filenames
<p>

   Definitions of classes that are only accessed via pointers (*) or
   references (&) shall not be included as include files.
<p>
<pre>
   filenames

        ".hh"   Include files
             ".cc"      Implementation files
             ".icc"     Inline definition files
             ".tcc"     non inline Template defs
</pre>
	     <p>
<pre>

   in emacs:

             (setq auto-mode-alist
                   (append '(("\\.make$" . makefile-mode)
                        ("\\.cc$" . c++-mode)
                        ("\\.icc$" . c++-mode)
                        ("\\.tcc$" . c++-mode)
                        ("\\.hh$" . c++-mode)
                        ("\\.pod$" . text-mode)
                        )
                      auto-mode-alist))
</pre>
<p>

   The class Class_name is coded in `class-name.*'
<p>

Indentation
<p>

   Standard GNU coding style is used.   In emacs:
<pre>

             (add-hook 'c++-mode-hook
                  '(lambda() (c-set-style "gnu")
                     )
                  )
<p>
</pre>

   If you like using font-lock, you can also add this to your `.emacs':
<pre>

             (setq font-lock-maximum-decoration t)
             (setq c++-font-lock-keywords-3
                   (append
                    c++-font-lock-keywords-3
                    '(("\\b\\(a-zA-Z_?+_\\)\\b" 1 font-lock-variable-name-face)                    ("\\b\\(A-Z?+a-z_?+\\)\\b" 1 font-lock-type-face))
                    ))
</pre>

Classes and Types
<p>
<pre>

             This_is_a_class
</pre>
<p>

Members
<p>

   Member variable names end with an underscore:
<p>
<pre>

     Type Class::member_
</pre>
<p>

Macros
<p>

   Macro names should be written in uppercase completely.

Broken code
<p>

   Try not to write broken code. This includes hardwired dependencies,
   hardwired constants, slow algorithms and obvious limitations. If you can
   not avoid it, mark the place clearly, and add a comment explaining
   shortcomings of the code.

Naming
<p>

   We used to adhere loosely on an almost bearable HungarianNotation
   variant, but we saw the light, and deprecated that.
<p>

   You may still find some remains of it in the code, but you're
   encouraged not to use silly names.
