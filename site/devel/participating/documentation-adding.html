<h1>Documentation suggestions</h1>

<p>
If you have suggestions for the documentation, please be as specific as
possible:

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;The docs for lyrics suck!&rdquo; or &ldquo;you should write
docs from a user's point of view!&rdquo; are not very useful
suggestions.

<li>Do <strong>not</strong> forward us a discussion from
<code>lilypond-user</code> with a note that &ldquo;this contains
info that should be in the manual!&rdquo;  That is not helpful; we
need to start reading the whole discussion to figure out what is
happening, then read the documentation to see what could be
clarified or added.  Please take the time to
write the exact changes to the text.  If you have been active in
the discussion, then you probably understand the material better than
we do.
</ul>

For additions to the documentation,
<ul>
<li>Tell us where the addition should be placed.  Please include both
the section number and title (i.e. "2.13 Printing lyrics").

<li>Please write <strong>exact</strong> changes to the text.

<li>
A formal patch to the source code is not required; we can take care
of the technical details.  Here is an imaginary example of a
perfect documentation report:

<pre>
To: lilypond-devel@gnu.org
From: helpful-user@example.net
Subject: doc addition 

In section 2.13 (printing lyrics), above the last line ("More options, like..."),
please add:
    
----
To add lyrics to a divided part, use blah blah blah.  For example,

\score {
 \notes {blah &#060;&#060;blah&#062;&#062; }
 \lyrics {blah &#060;&#060;blah&#062;&#062; }
 blah blah blah
}
----

In addition, the second sentence of the first paragraph is
confusing.  Please delete that sentence (it begins "Users
often...") and replace it with this:
----
To align lyrics with something, do this thing.
----

Have a nice day,
Helpful User
</pre>
</ul>


To replace large sections of the documentation, the guidelines
are stricter.  We cannot remove parts of the current documentation
unless we are certain that the new version is an improvement.

<ul>
<li>Split your work into small sections; this makes it much easier
to compare the new and old documentation.

<li>Please prepare a formal patch with <tt>diff -u</tt>

</ul>

<hr>
<p>
Once you have followed these guidelines, please send a message to
<a href="http://post.gmane.org/post.php?group=gmane.comp.gnu.lilypond.devel">
lilypond-devel</a>
with your documentation submissions.  We may edit your suggestion
for spelling, grammar, or style, and we may
not place the material exactly where you suggested, but if you give us
some material to work with, we can improve the manual much faster.

<p>
Thanks for your interest!
