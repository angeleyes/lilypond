<h1>LilyPond Snippet Repository</h1>

<p>
The LilyPond Snippet Respository (affectionately known as LSR) is a
collection of small examples.  It can be easily searched for special
tricks, or simply browsed to see some neat examples.  You can also
add your own examples, so that other LilyPond users can benefit from
your knowledge.  Visit the <a href="http://lsr.dsi.unimi.it/">LSR</a>
and see for yourself!

<h1>Documentation suggestions</h1>

<p>
If you have suggestions for the documentation, please be as specific as
possible.  &ldquo;The docs for lyrics suck!&rdquo; isn't a very useful
suggestion.  Instead, please tell us exactly what to change and where
to change it.  For example,
  
<pre>
http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.4/Documentation/user/out-www/lilypond/Printing-lyrics.html
In section 2.13 (printing lyrics), above the last line ("More options, like..."),
please add:
    
----
To add lyrics to a divided part, use foo bar.  For example,

\score {
 \notes {blah &#060;&#060;blah&#062;&#062; }
 \lyrics {blah &#060;&#060;blah&#062;&#062; }
 blah blah blah
}
----
</pre>

We may edit your suggestion (for spelling, grammar, or style), and we may
not place the material exactly where you suggested, but if you give us
some material to work with, we can improve the manual much faster.
