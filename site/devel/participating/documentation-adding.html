<h1>LilyPond Snippet Repository</h1>

<p>
The LilyPond Snippet Repository (affectionately known as LSR) is a
collection of small examples.  It can be easily searched for special
tricks, or simply browsed to see some neat examples.  You can also
add your own examples, so that other LilyPond users can benefit from
your knowledge.  Visit the <a href="http://lsr.dsi.unimi.it/">LSR</a>
and see for yourself!

<h1>Documentation suggestions</h1>

<p>
If you have suggestions for the documentation, please be as specific as
possible.  &ldquo;The docs for lyrics suck!&rdquo; isn't a very useful
suggestion.  Instead, please tell us exactly what to change and where
to change it.  Do <strong>not</strong> forward us a discussion from
<code>lilypond-user</code> with a note that &ldquo;this contains
info that should be in the manual!&rdquo;  That is not helpful; we
need to start reading the whole discussion to figure out what is
happening, then read the documentation to see what could be
clarified or added.  <strong>Please</strong> take the time to
write the exact changes to the text.  If you have been active in
the discussion, then you probably understand the material better than
we do.
<p>

A formal patch to the source code is not required.  Simply
send an email to
<a href="http://mail.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/lilypond-devel">lilypond-devel@gnu.org</a>
with your addition to the documentation.  We will take care of the technical
details.  Here is an imaginary example of a perfect documentation report:
  
<pre>
To: lilypond-devel@gnu.org
From: helpful-user@example.net
Subject: doc addition 

In section 2.13 (printing lyrics), above the last line ("More options, like..."),
please add:
    
----
To add lyrics to a divided part, use blah blah blah.  For example,

\score {
 \notes {blah &#060;&#060;blah&#062;&#062; }
 \lyrics {blah &#060;&#060;blah&#062;&#062; }
 blah blah blah
}
----

In addition, the second sentence of the first paragraph is
confusing.  Please delete that sentence (it begins "Users
often...") and replace it with this:
----
To align lyrics with something, do this thing.
----

Have a nice day,
Helpful User

We may edit your suggestion for spelling, grammar, or style, and we may
not place the material exactly where you suggested, but if you give us
some material to work with, we can improve the manual much faster.
