<h1>Documentation suggestions</h1>

<h2>Grand Documentation Project</h2>

<p>
  LilyPond documentation is currently revised in depth.  This revision
  is called the Grand Documentation Project (GDP), it started in
  September 2007 and will end before 2.14 release.  GDP is discuted on
  the <a href="@DEPTH@/about/index#contact">mailing lists</a>, which you
  can search the archives and suscribe to for more information
</p>

<p>
  If you plan to make any documentation suggestion or submission, it
  is a good idea to know about GDP progress by reading lilypond-devel
  and lilypond-user mailing lists, so your contributions can be
  efficiently integrated into the GDP.  You can find detailed
  instructions for contributing to GDP
  at <a href="http://git.sv.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=lilypond.git;a=blob_plain;f=Documentation/user/README.txt;hb=master">Manuals Readme</a>.
</p>


<h2>Small additions</h2>

<p>
For additions to the documentation,
<ul>
<li>Tell us where the addition should be placed.  Please include both
the section number and title (i.e. "2.13 Printing lyrics").

<li>Please write <strong>exact</strong> changes to the text.

<li>
A formal patch to the source code is not required; we can take care
of the technical details.  Here is an example of a
perfect documentation report:

<pre>
To: lilypond-devel@gnu.org
From: helpful-user@example.net
Subject: doc addition 

In section 2.13 (printing lyrics), above the last line ("More options, like..."),
please add:
    
----
To add lyrics to a divided part, use blah blah blah.  For example,

\score {
 \notes {blah &#060;&#060;blah&#062;&#062; }
 \lyrics {blah &#060;&#060;blah&#062;&#062; }
 blah blah blah
}
----

In addition, the second sentence of the first paragraph is
confusing.  Please delete that sentence (it begins "Users
often...") and replace it with this:
----
To align lyrics with something, do this thing.
----

Have a nice day,
Helpful User
</pre>
</ul>


<h2>Larger contributions</h2>

To replace large sections of the documentation, the guidelines
are stricter.  We cannot remove parts of the current documentation
unless we are certain that the new version is an improvement.

<ul>
<li>Split your work into small sections; this makes it much easier
to compare the new and old documentation.

<li>Please prepare a formal patch with <tt>diff -u</tt>

<li>Ask on the <tt>lilypond-devel</tt> maillist if such a
rewrite is necessary.
</ul>

<br>
Once you have followed these guidelines, please send a message to
<a href="http://post.gmane.org/post.php?group=gmane.comp.gnu.lilypond.devel">
lilypond-devel</a>
with your documentation submissions.  Unfortunately there is a strict
&ldquo;no top-posting&rdquo; check; to avoid this, add
<pre>
> I'm not top posting.
</pre>
(you must include the <tt>></tt> ) to the top of your documentation addition.

<p>
We may edit your suggestion
for spelling, grammar, or style, and we may
not place the material exactly where you suggested, but if you give us
some material to work with, we can improve the manual much faster.
Thanks for your interest!
