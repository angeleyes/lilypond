	
Development is discussed on the mailing development mailing list
(lilypond-devel@gnu.org).  Do keep in touch through the mailing list
about what you do, as we have rather high standards for code
contributions.


Keep following in mind:
<ul>
<li> scratch  your  own itch
<li> don't ask questions, but dive into the code first
</ul>
