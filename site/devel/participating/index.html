<h2>Brilliant hackers</h2>

We want our patches cooked as follows:

<ul>
  <li>Follow the <a href=standards.html>coding standards.</a>.
  <li>No complete files, only diffs
  <li>Unified diff (<tt>diff -u</tt>). 
  <li>ChangeLog entries
  
  <li>patches for <tt>Documentation/topdocs/AUTHORS.texi</tt> and
    <tt>THANKS</tt>, if appropriate.
</ul>


Our entry point is in <tt>main()</tt> (<tt>lily/main.cc</tt>). Grep
the source code for TODO for inspiration.  Good luck.

<h2>&ldquo;But I am not brilliant!&rdquo</h2>

There is lots to do, and not all of it requires programming. Read our
<a href="call-for-help.html">call for help</a> for more information.



<h2>Submitting patches</h2>
<p>
  If you want to contribute fixes of any kind, use the following
  procedure
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Check out the latest sources from
    <a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/cvs/?group=lilypond">CVS</a>.

    <pre>
      cvs -z3 -d :ext:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot/lilypond co lilypond
    </pre>

  <li>Make your changes,

  <li>Add an entry to the <tt>ChangeLog</tt> file (In Emacs: <tt>C-x 4 a</tt>)

  <li>Create a patch:
    <pre>
      cd lilypond/   # go to the top of the source tree 
      cvs diff -u &gt; patch
    </pre>
    
  <li>Send an email with the ChangeLog at the top, and the patch
    attached to <tt>lilypond-devel@gnu.org</tt>, or to one of the
    maintainers.
</ul>


<h2>Documentation suggestions</h2>
<p>
If you have suggestions for the documentation, please be as specific as
possible.  &ldquo;The docs for lyrics suck!&rdquo; isn't a very useful
suggestion.  Instead, please tell us exactly what to change and where
to change it.  For example,

<pre>
http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.4/Documentation/user/out-www/lilypond/Printing-lyrics.html
In section 2.13 (printing lyrics), above the last line ("More options, like..."),
please add:

----
To add lyrics to a divided part, use foo bar.  For example,

\score {
 \notes {blah &#060;&#060;blah&#062;&#062; }
 \lyrics {blah &#060;&#060;blah&#062;&#062; }
 blah blah blah
}
----
</pre>

We may edit your suggestion (for spelling, grammar, or style), and we may
not place the material exactly where you suggested, but if you give us
some material to work with, we can improve the manual much faster than
if you simply suggest &ldquo;why don't you add more stuff about lyrics
to the docs?&rdquo;
