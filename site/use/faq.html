<h2>Tweaking layout</h2>

<h3>
 How do I change the tagline 'Lily was here'?
</h3>

<p>
In the `\header' field, add a `tagline' entry, e.g.
</p>

<pre>
  tagline="Typeset by GNU <a href="http://lilypond.org/wiki/?LilyPond">LilyPond</a>-\LilyPondVersion"
</pre>

<h3>
Can I make blank manuscript paper with <a href="http://lilypond.org/wiki/?LilyPond">LilyPond</a>?
</h3>

<p>
Theoretically, yes but <a href="http://lilypond.org/wiki/?BlankMusicPaper">BlankMusicPaper</a> is easier to do with (La)TeX.
</p>
<h3>
 How do I combine multiple pieces into one document?
</h3>
<p>
There are several solutions:
</p>
<ul>
<li> This produces one combined `foo.dvi'

</ul>
<pre>
          	ly2dvi foo.ly bar.ly
</pre>
<ul>
<li> Make a toplevel `.ly' file that contains al pieces:
</ul>
<pre>
          	% booklet.ly
          	\input "piece-1.ly"
          	\input "piece-2.ly"
          	\input "piece-3.ly"
</pre>
<ul>
<li> make a hybrid TeX or texinfo and <a href="http://lilypond.org/wiki/?LilyPond">LilyPond</a> document using <a href="http://lilypond.org/wiki/?LilyPondBook">LilyPondBook</a>

</ul>
<p>
For the first two solutions, you will need to move `\header' info in
each individual piece from toplevel into the `\paper' block.
</p>
<p>
There are several examples in the `mutopia' directory.
</p>
<h3>
 How do I change the page layout?
</h3>
<p>
The height and width of the music on each page is set using the
paper variables `textheight' and `linewidth' in the input file.  If you
want to change the placement of the page number or the layout of the
title, you could run `lilypond infile.ly' and include the generated
`infile.tex' file in your own LaTeX wrapper file. The easiest way is to
start from the ly2dvi default layout, using the following steps
(assuming that the input file is `infile.ly':
</p>
<ul>
<li> `ly2dvi --keep infile.ly'

</ul>
<ul>
<li> Edit the generated LaTeX file `ly2dvi.out.tex'  to get the desired layout. Some aspects are determined in
</ul>
<p>
the file titledefs.tex.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Run `latex ly2dvi.out.tex'
</ul>
<ul>
<li> If you update the lilypond file, run `lilypond infile.ly'
</ul>
<p>

and then `latex ly2dvi.out'. Another alternative is to use `lilypond-book', where smaller or larger music examples can be included in a LaTeX or Texinfo file.
</p>
<h3>
 The tagline is visible in the .dvi file but is not printed on paper.
</h3>
<p>
The default page size is A4. If you use letter sized papers, add the
following at the top of your lilypond file.
</p>
<pre>
	\paper{
	    papersize="letter"
	}
	\include "paper20.ly"
</pre>
<p>
(Note that setting the papersize in the ordinary paper section inside
a score declaration will not have the desired effect.)  The default
paper size can be set globally for the installation in the file
`declarations.ly'.
</p>
<p>

Note also that even if this produces a .dvi file of the correct size,
dvips will still use its default paper size, unless you explicitly
ask for something else. Example: 'dvips -t letter'. The default
paper size of the dvips installation can be changed with texconfig.
</p>

<h2>Non standard notation</h2>


<h3> Do you support guitar fret diagrams?</h3>

No. We ourselves don't play guitar, and don't know the fine points of this notation. We would welcome anyone who could give this a try.

Or you can try <tt>gchords.sty</tt> from Kasper Peeters. Write in chords.tex e.g.
<pre>

	\usepackage{gchords}
	\smallchords\def\xoff{0}\def\yoff{0}\def\numfrets{4}
	\newcommand{\hangit}[2][t]{\raisebox{-\height}{\chord{#1}{#2}{}}}
	\newcommand{\C}{\hangit{x,f3p3,f2p2,n,f1p1,n}}
	\newcommand{\dSevenC}{\hangit{x,f3p3,n,f2p2,f4p3,f1p1}}

	</pre>
and then you can say
<pre>
	\header { latexheaders = chords }
	...
	\notes { e_"\\C" d' f'_"\\dSevenC" a ...
</pre>
Or try http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/gtrchord-eps/

<h3>
Do you support Gregorian chant notation?
</h3>

No. (Not yet?)

Juergen Reuter is has been adding Edition Vaticana symbols to the Feta
Font, and is working on ligatures.
