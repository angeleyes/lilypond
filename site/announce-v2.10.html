<title>LilyPond 2.10 now available</title>

<h1>LilyPond version 2.10 available - 10 years anniversary release</h1>

Utrecht the Netherlands--November, 2006.
<p>
The inspiration for LilyPond came when ten years ago two befriended
musicians were disappointed with the bland and boring look of computer
print-outs. Every musician prefers to read beautiful music, so
couldn't we programmers solve that printing problem?
<p>

LilyPond just does that: it prints music in the best traditions of
classical engraving with minimum fuss.  Don't waste time on tuning
spacing, moving around symbols, or shaping slurs.  Impress friends and
colleagues with sharp sheet music!
<p>
We are proud to announce the 10-year anniversary release, LilyPond
version 2.10.


<h2>New stuff</h2>

Creating music with good page turning points is easier than ever. The
new page breaker will tune horizontal and vertical spacing to ensure
that page turns only fall at rests or places that you mark explicitly.


The release also contains many smaller improvements,

<ul>

<li> falls and doits, dashed barlines, al niente hairpins, and right hand
fingerings for guitar.

<li> formatting improvements in tied chords, automatic beaming, 
nested tuplets, and much more.

<li>stream based music representation.
<p>

  LilyPond uses an elegant input format, that uses identifiers,
  arbitrary nested structures and inline Scheme expressions.  While
  the format is easy to write and read for humans, it is less so for
  programs.
<p>
  With this release, Erik Sandberg has contributed internal rewrites
  that make it possible to output a much simpler intermediate format.
  In the long term, this will enable other programs to read LilyPond
  music.
  
<li> automated testing, to prevent older bugs from reappearing.

<li> Docbook and PDFLaTeX support in lilypond-book.
<li> completely revised manual.
</ul>
