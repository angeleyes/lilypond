<title>LilyPond 2.10 now available</title>

<h1>LilyPond version 2.10 available - prettier music than ever</h1>

Utrecht the Netherlands--November, 2006.
<p>
After 9 months of furious programming, the LilyPond Development Team
is proud to announce LilyPond 2.10.0, software for better looking music
notation.
<p>

The inspiration for LilyPond came when two befriended musicians got
annoyed with the bland and boring look of computer print-out. Every
musician prefers reading beautiful music, so couldn't we programmers
solve that printing problem?
<p>

LilyPond just does that: it prints music in the best traditions of
classical engraving with minimum fuss.  Don't waste time on tuning
spacing, moving around symbols, or shaping slurs.  Impress friends and
colleagues with sharp sheet music!


<h2>New stuff</h2>

Creating music with good page turning points is easier than ever. The
new page breaker will tune horizontal and vertical spacing to ensure
that page turns only fall at rests or places that you mark explicitly.


The release also contains many smaller improvements,

<ul>

<li> Falls and doits, dashed barlines, al niente hairpins, right hand
fingerings for guitar.

<li> Formatting improvements in tied chords, automatic beaming,
nested

<li>Stream based music representation
<p>

  LilyPond uses a very elegant input format, that uses identifiers,
  arbitrary nested structures and inline Scheme expressions.  As such,
  it is hard for other programs to parse.
<p>
  With this release, Erik Sandberg has contributed internal rewrites
  that make it possible to output a much simpler intermediate format.
  On the long term, this will enable other programss to read LilyPond.

  <li> Docbook and PDFLaTeX support in lilypond-book
<li> Completely revised manual
</ul>
