<p>
LilyPond is a text-based tool.  It does <em>not</em> have a graphical
  user interface with menus and help screens.  Therefore,
  users of GUI-centric systems like Windows need to
  learn a new way of working.  Several resources are provided to
  help users learn the LilyPond way and accomplish the goal of
  typesetting beautiful scores.

<h2>The LilyPond crash course</h2>

<p>
  The <a href="../switch/howto">LilyPond crash course</a> gives a brief overview
  of the essential elements of LilyPond, along with a vision of some of
  the capabilities of the program.  However, the crash course alone is
  not enough to understand how to effectively use LilyPond, which brings
  us to ...

<h2>The LilyPond Learning Manual</h2>

<p>
  The <a href="@DOC@stable/Documentation/user/lilypond-learning/index">LilyPond Learning Manual</a> has been written with the
  needs of both new LilyPond users and users experienced in previous versions
  of LilyPond in mind.
  It covers the fundamentals of LilyPond and has proven to be the most 
  effective way for users to get up to speed with the latest version of
  LilyPond.  If you have not yet done so, you should read the Learning Manual
  from cover to cover.  (Because the Learning Manual from version 2.12 is
  greatly improved over version 2.10, all users should use the 
  Learning Manual from version 2.12).
  When you're done with the learning manual, you'll know generally how to
  get work done in LilyPond, but from time to time you'll need more specific
  information, which is available in ...
</p>
 
<h2>The LilyPond documentation</h2>

<p>
  In addition to the Learning Manual, the LilyPond Documentation for the 
  <a href="@DOC@stable/Documentation">stable release</a> or the
  <a href="@DOC@latest/Documentation">development
  release</a> contains
  a Notation Reference, and Application Usage manual, and an
  Internals Reference manual.  These manuals, which are available
  on the web and can be installed on your computer, 
  explain the details of working
  with LilyPond.
</p>

<h2>Additional resources</h2>

<p>
  In addition to the LilyPond documentation, you can get information from
  the <a href="../about/faq">LilyPond FAQ</a> and the 
  <a href="http://lilypondwiki.tuxfamily.org"> LilyPond
  wiki</a>.  Although not an official LilyPond site, the LilyPond wiki
  has information that is particularly helpful for new users.
</p>

<p>
  The <a href="http://lsr.dsi.unimi.it">LilyPond Snippet Repository</a> 
  contains fragments
  of LilyPond files that have been created to solve particular problems.
  A search of this online database is often quite helpful in figuring out
  how to do something.
</p>
  
<h2>The lilypond-user mailing list</h2>

<p>
  Once you've tried doing something on your own with the help of the
  resources listed above, there is a lilypond-user mailing list.  You can
  subscribe to the list at the 
  <a href="http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/lilypond-user">
  lilypond-user subscribe page</a>.
  Before posting to the list, you should search the archives, available 
  (with different interfaces) at
  <a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/lilypond-user/">
    lilypond-user archives</a>, at 
  <a href="http://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.lilypond.general"> gmane </a>,
  or at <a href="http://www.nabble.com/Gnu---Lilypond---User-f1722.html">
  Nabble</a>.  You can use whichver archive interface best suits
  your work style.
</p>

<p>
  When it's time to ask a question on the -user list, you'll have the best
  success if it's a well-formulated question.  
  <a href="http://www.gerv.net/hacking/how-to-ask-good-questions/">
  Here is a good overview</a> of how to ask good questions. 
</p>

<h2>Reporting bugs</h2>

<p>
  Like any software, LilyPond still contains bugs or limitations.  If
  LilyPond produces flawed output (such as collisions between various
  objects), or crashes, or behaves differently than is described in the
  documentation, then please report this as a potential bug. 
  <a href="../devel/participating/bugs">Guidelines for bug reports</a> 
  are listed on the LilyPond
  website.
</p>

<p>
  New users sometimes believe LilyPond is not working, when in fact it is 
  working perfectly.  <em> Please don't report a bug until you've read
  the Learning Manual to be sure you know how to use LilyPond</em>.
