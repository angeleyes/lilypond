<h1>Donate to LilyPond development</h1> 

<p>

<p>
Three good reasons to sponsor LilyPond development: 
<ul>
<li>More sponsors means more time for LilyPond.
<p>
Without sponsors, we have to pursue other work to feed ourselves and
our families, and will have less time to improve LilyPond.

<li>With your support, we can support you.

<p>
With a donation, your platform, your needs, your platform, your
wishes, your feature-requests and your bug-reports will get extra
attention.

<li>Everyone benefits.

<p>
Helping us helps others, since every improvement made for you will be
passed on to the rest of the user community.

</ul>

LilyPond is free/open-source software. Using, copying and changing is
and will remain free. If you want LilyPond to stay healthy and active,
then sponsor us.

<p>
