<h1>Donate to LilyPond development</h1> 

<p>

<p>
Three good reasons to sponsor LilyPond development: 
<ul>
<li>More sponsors means more time for LilyPond.
<p>
Without sponsors, we have to pursue other jobs to feed ourselves and
our families, and will have less time to improve LilyPond.

<li>With your support, we can support you.

<p>
Extra attention for your platform, your needs, your
platform, your wishes, your feature-requests and your bug-reports.

<li>Everyone benefits.

<p>
Every improvement made for you will be passed on to the rest of the
user community, so helping us helps others.

</ul>

LilyPond is free/open-source software. Using, copying and changing it
is and will remain free. If you want LilyPond to stay healthy and
active, then sponsor us.
