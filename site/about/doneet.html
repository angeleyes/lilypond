<h1>Donate to LilyPond development</h1> 

<p>
<! ideas taken from Sodipodi website. Thanks, Lauris !>

LilyPond is libre software: using, copying and changing is and will
remain free. Nevertheless, donating money to the LilyPond project is a
good idea:

<ul>
<li>The positive feedback keeps us motivated.

<li>It pays for attending conferences and shows, which will attract
more users and more developers.

<li>It motivates developers to support <em>your</em> platform.

<li>It motivates developers to write the features that <em>you</em>
want, not those that are cool to write.

<li>It will get you those warm, fuzzy vibes for doing something good.

<li>It pays for the beverages that will inspire us to write even
cooler features :-)

</ul>

The alternative to donating is <a

suggested amount is EUR 20.
<p>
Send your donation via <a href="http://www.paypal.com">PayPal</a> to
hanwen@xs4all.nl.  Don't forget to tell us your special wishes (which
platform you use, what kind of music you print, and/or which features
you want)
