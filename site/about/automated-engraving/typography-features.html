<h2>Font design</h2>

A large factor that makes LilyPond output look traditional lies in the
blackness of the page. By using heavy stafflines, and a font design to
match that, the overall impression is much stronger. This is also very
clear from the following blowups:

<table align=center><tr><td>
<img src=@IMAGES@henle-flat-bw.png></td>
<td>
<img src=@IMAGES@baer-flat-bw.png></td>
<td>
<img src=@IMAGES@lily-flat-bw.png></td>
</tr><tr>
<td align=center>Henle (2000)</td>
<td align=center>B&auml;renreiter (1950)</td>
<td align=center>LilyPond (2003)</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
Another typical aspect of hand-engraved scores is the general look of
the symbols: they never have sharp corners. We suspect that this is
due to the mechanics of the reproduction process.  This general
rounded shape is also present in all glyphs of our "Feta" font.



 
<h2>Spacing</h2>

<p>

One of the problems that the Bach piece above inspired us to attack,
is the spacing engine. One of its features is optical spacing.
It is demonstrated in the fragment below.

<p>

This fragment only uses quarter notes: notes that are played in a
constant rhythm. The spacing should reflect that. Unfortunately, the
eye deceives us a little: not only does it notice the distance between
note heads, it also takes into account the distance between
consecutive stems. As a result, the notes of an up-stem/down-stem
combination should be put farther apart, and the notes of a down-up
combination should be put closer together, all depending on the
combined vertical positions of the notes. The top fragment is printed
with this correction, the bottom one without.  In the last case, the
down-stem/up-stems combinations form clumps of notes.
