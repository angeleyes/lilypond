<h2>Music engraving</h2>


When we know what symbols to print, we have to decide where to put
them so the the result looks pleasing. This art is called <em>music
engraving</em>.  The term derives from the traditional process of
music printing.  Only a few decades ago, sheet music was made by
cutting and stamping the music into zinc or pewter plates in mirror
image.  The plate would be inked, and the depressions caused by the
cutting and stamping would hold ink.  An image was formed by pressing
paper to the plate. The stamping and cutting was completely done by
hand. Making corrections was cumbersome, so engraving had to be done
correctly in one go. Of course, this was a highly specialized skill

<li> Music engraving is a traditional craft, and was learned in
practice. An accomplished master had to complete around 10 years of
practice.

<li> Most of the knowledge was passed from master to apprentice during
practical training. Consequently, little has been explicitly laid down
about the rules of elegant engraving.

<li> Finally, engraving is about selecting proper distance and
blackness for scores. <img align=right src="@IMAGES@stone-distance.png"> The
quality of the end result must judged visually. This is virtually
impossible to capture in formal rules.
