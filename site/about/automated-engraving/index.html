<h2>What is behind LilyPond?</h2>


<img src="@IMAGES@hader-collage.jpeg" align=right>



LilyPond is not unique in making music notation: there are a lot of
programs that print music, and nowadays most of the newly printed
music is made with computers.  Unfortunately, that also shows: just
ask any musician that plays classical music: new scores do not look as
nice as old ones.

What is the difference between hand-work and machine work, and what
has caused it?  How can we improve the situation?  This essay explains
problems in music notation (software), and our approach to solving
them.  Start reading <a href=introduction.html>here</a>.
