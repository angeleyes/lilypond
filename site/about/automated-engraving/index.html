<h2>What is behind LilyPond?</h2>


<img src="@IMAGES@hader-collage.jpeg" align=right>



LilyPond is not unique in making music notation: there are a lot of
programs that print music, and nowadays most of the newly printed
music is made with computers.  Unfortunately, that also shows: just
ask any musician that plays classical music: new scores do not look as
nice as old ones.

<p>
What is the difference between hand-work and machine work, and what
has caused it?  How can we improve the situation?  This essay explains
problems in music notation (software), and our approach to solving
them.
