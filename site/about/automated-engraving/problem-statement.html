<h2>Designing notation software: how not to do it</h2>
<p>


It would be nice if notation software didn't need any babysitting to
produce acceptable output. 

Our goal with <em>LilyPond</em> was to write such a system: a program
that will produce beautiful music ("engraving") automatically.

<p>
At first sight, music notation follows a straightforward hierarchical
pattern.  Consider the example below, with two staves containing two
measures.

<p>
Isn't writing software all about finding hierarchies and modeling the
real world in terms of trees? In the view of a naive programmer, the
above fragment of notation is easily abstracted to a nested set of
boxes

<p>

</p>

It's easy to follow this model when writing software.  It's obvious
how to store this data in memory, and writing on disk can be easily
mirrored. In an XML-file you could write something like

<PRE>
  &lt;score&gt;
    &lt;staff&gt;
      &lt;measure id="1"&gt;
         &lt;chord length="1/2"&gt;
	   &lt;pitch name="c"&gt;
         &lt;/chord&gt;
         &lt;chord&gt;
	 
	 ....
      &lt;/measure&gt;
    &lt;/staff&gt;
  &lt;/score&gt;
</PRE>

<p>
In short, this model is obvious, simple and neat.  It's the format
used by a lot software. Unfortunately, it's also wrong.  The
hierarchical representation works for a lot of simpler music, but it
falls apart for advanced use. Consider the following example:
</p>

<p>
In this example, several assumptions of the previous model are
violated: staves start and stop at will, voices jump around between
staves, and sometimes span two staves.
<p>

Music notation is really different from music itself. Notation is an
intricate symbolic diagramming language for visualizing an often much
simpler musical concept. Hence, software should reflect that separation.
