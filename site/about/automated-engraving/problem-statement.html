<h2>Better music notation software</h2>
<p>

Most notation software needs babysitting to produce acceptable output.
In our opinion, all this tweaking and tuning is something that a
computer should do for you.

Our goal with <em>LilyPond</em> is to write an an <em>automated
engraving system</em>: a system that will produce beautiful music
("engraving") automatically.  In concept, such a system is simple: the
objective of such a system is to produce music notation, a graphical
image.  The content of this picture is music: pitches and
durations. In automated system, we want to generate the form from the
content, so schematically, the program could be represented as

<table>
<tr>
<td align="center">
<img src="@IMAGES@simple-notation.png">
</td>
<td align="center">
&lt;--
</td>
<td align="center">
<tt>\notes { c'4 d'8 }</tt>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">
form
</td>
<td align="center">
LilyPond
</td>
<td align="center">
content
</td>
</tr>
</table>
