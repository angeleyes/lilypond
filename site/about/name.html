<em>Why did we call it LilyPond?</em>

<p>
  Han-Wen: I started Lily (our affectionate name for LilyPond) in
  1996.  Back then, I was in an amateur symphony orchestra together with
  Jan.  I had a crush on this magnificent girl in the orchestra: her
  name was Suzanne, she played both the flute and the cello, and (of
  course) I thought she was very pretty.
</p>

<p>
  At the time, Jan was dating Roos (Dutch for &lsquo;Rose&rsquo; &ndash;
  she also played the cello).  I also knew about a package
  Rosegarden (a GUI MIDI sequencer and notation editor).  When I found
  out that &lsquo;Susan&rsquo; is Hebrew for &lsquo;lily&rsquo;, I
  decided that calling the package &lsquo;LilyPond&rsquo; would match
  the nomenclature of the rest of my life perfectly.
</p>

<p>
  Some things don't last &ndash; the two girls, the cellos and the
  orchestra, all have disappeared from our lives.  LilyPond however,
  has survived.  It is a mature package with a healthy user-base and
  good prospects.  Best of all is, that we still have a good time
  hacking on it
</p>


<p>
Incidentally, the <a

alive. Among others, it has support for LilyPond export.
