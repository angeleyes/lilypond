<h2>LilyPond was brought to you by</h2>

<ul>

<li>Han-Wen Nienhuys and Jan Nieuwenhuizen, core development
<p>
Jan is currently working as a Programmer/Open Source specialist.  Jan
 plays the viola. Han-Wen is setting up a company in LilyPond
 support. In the remaining time, he tries to master the French Horn.
<p>
 Jan and Han-Wen met in a youth orchestra in the Netherlands.  During
  that time, Jan was tinkering with MusicTeX preprocessors, and got
  Han-Wen interested.  When he joined in it was decided that we should
  start afresh with a completely different approach.  What we created
  is now known as LilyPond.
