<h2>LilyPond was brought to you by</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Han-Wen Nienhuys and Jan Nieuwenhuizen, core development
    <p>
      Han-Wen is working as a Senior Software Engineer at Google.  He
      plays the French Horn and has recently taken up the challenge of
      playing the Trombone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jan is working as a Senior Free Software Engineer at Novell.
      His current assignment is OpenOffice.org.  He plays the Viola
      and a weird, limited repetoire of Bach/Rachmaninov on the Piano.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jan and Han-Wen met in a youth orchestra in the Netherlands.  During
      that time, Jan was tinkering with MusicTeX preprocessors, and got
      Han-Wen interested.  When he joined in it was decided that they should
      start afresh with a completely different approach.  What they created
      is now known as LilyPond.
