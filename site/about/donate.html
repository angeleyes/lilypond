Help the development team by registering
LilyPond.

<h2> Why register?</h2>

<ul>

<li>
  Time is money. If we are paid, we have more time to spend on
  LilyPond.
  
<li>
   You pay us money, and we pay attention to you by packaging for
   <em>your</em> platform, or implementing that feature that
   <em>you</em> so desperately need.
 
<li>Helping us gets you those warm, fuzzy vibes!
</ul>
