<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3>What is LilyPond?</h3>
<p>
We like to call LilyPond an "automated engraving system." It will
format music notation beautifully without requiring typographical
expertise of its users.

<p>


<h3>Automatic notation, so that means I can play the music, and then
it rolls out of the printer?</h3>
<p>

No.  Our system assumes that the input data is available in an exact,
abstract form.  Printing music is difficult enough as it is, so we do
not wish to add another problem.  Translating what a human plays to
exact form is hard. Even if you get the correct pitch data from a MIDI
keyboard (as opposed to a sound recording), one has to get the rhythms
correct. For example, how is a computer supposed to distinguish
between a staccato quarter note and an eighth note?  Moreover, how
would you print a piece that you cannot play in such a system?

<p>

<h3>There are other program that do notation. What's so special about
yours?</h3>

<p>
Yes, there are many other programs that "do" notation.  However,
anyone who plays both from recent editions and old (pre 1970) can
attest that modern computer printouts do not look nice: they have a
bland, mechanical look.  By contrast, we try to mimick traditional
plate engraving in the general impression, layout algorithms, and
the font design. Consequently, our output often beats our competitors
when it comes to good looks.
<p>

<h3>What is wrong with other computer printed scores?</h3>
<p>
Computer printed scores often lack subtle variations in spacing, which
results in mechanical look. To prevent clashes between different
symbols, they are spaced very widely, which leads to an "airy"
look. The heaviness of the layout is matched to that airy look: the
symbols are usually too light, and the lines are too thin.  The wide
spacing also causes a piece of music to take up more pages. Beams
often do not cover stafflines entirely, while slurs and ties do touch
them, leading to distracting clusters of black and wedges of white
around these places.
<p>

<h3>How can I tell?</h3>
<p>
Normally, one notices these details only subconsiously. The best way
to become conscious of these differences is to compare a traditionally
printed and a computer printed edition of the same piece, preferably
with a magnifying glass.  If you are not sure: traditional engraving
is photographically reproduced hand-work, and can recognized by a
slightly irregularities in symbol placement, and small blotches due to
the reproduction process.

<p>

<h3>What is engraving?</h3>
<p>
Originally, music was printed by stamping and engraving symbols
mirrored into metal plates. The plates were inked, and paper was
pressed to it, yielding a left-to-right printing.  Hence, professional
music typography is now known as engraving, even when it is done with
computers today. People who do this are called engravers or copyists.

<p>

<h3>Why do you care about engraving?</h3>
<p>
We think that beautiful music deserves to be printed with a beautiful
layout.
<p>

<h3>Why would I care about engraving?</h3>
<p>
Typography is art, but is foremost a "useful art": good engraving
helps to read the music, making it is easier to play from.  For
example, if the layout reflects the character of a piece, then it is
easier to interpret.  If it is tightly spaced, it will take less
pages, reducing the number of page-turns. If a system (a `line') has a
unique horizontal layout, then it is more easily found back after
looking away at the conductor. A part which is printed with heavy
symbols and thick lines will be easier to read from a distance.

<h3>You say your program is special; you must be trying to sell
it?</h3>

<p>
No.  We are giving the program away for free. You can download it <a
href=../download/>here</a>. 

<h3>Then you give it away for free now, but will start charging in the
future?</h3>

<p>
No.  We do only give it away for free, but we also deliver it with
full source code, and permission to distribute, modify, sell or
mutilate it.  In other words, LilyPond is libre software; it is part
of the GNU project, and distributed under the terms GNU GPL.
<p>

<h3>How do you make a living?</h3>

<p>
Good question. We started LilyPond in 1996, and we always did it as an
unpaid hobby. We would like to change that.  Since we are not selling
the program, we sell our expertise. Practically speaking, you can pay
us for implementing features, or you can hire us engraving music or
doing typography research. Contact us privately if you are interested.
<p>
Of course, if you like LilyPond, feel free to give us <a
href="donate.html">a small donation</a>.
<p>

<h3>Who are you guys anyway?</h3>

<p>
We are Jan and Han-Wen, from the Netherlands. We met in a youth
orchestra, where Jan was tinkering with MusicTeX preprocessors. When
Han-Wen joined in it was decided that we should start afresh. What we
created is now known as LilyPond.
<p>

<h2>About the program.</h2>

<h3>It's open source, so I should compile it from source?</h3>
<p>
No. Building LilyPond is a rather involved process. Unless you really
know what you are doing, it is better to use a binary package.
<p>

<h3>Which version should I use?</h3>
<p>
We use the version numbering scheme that is also used for the Linux
kernel. This means that even minor versions (1.4, 1.6, etc.) are
stable, and active development is done on the uneven minor versions
(1.5, 1.7).  Unless you have special needs, it is best to stick to the
stable branch.
<p>

<h3>How is LilyPond used?</h3>

<p>
LilyPond is a compiler: the music is encoded in a <tt>.ly</tt> file.
Then LilyPond is run on it by invoking the <tt>ly2dvi</tt>, which
takes run the actual <tt>lilypond</tt> program to format the music,
and adds titling information and page layout.  The resulting DVI can
be viewed with T<sub>E</sub>X's DVI tools.
<p>


<h3>What is the input format?</h3>
<p>
We have designed our own input format, the <tt>.ly</tt> format.  It is
a language that encodes music using expressions. These music
expressions are composed of simpler music expressions, where the
simplest expressions are notes and rests. This is analogous to how
arithmetical expressions can be broken down in simpler expressions,
where the simplest expressions are numbers, operators.
<p>


<h3>There are lots of good formats, why not use ABC, MusicXML or
NIFF or DARMS?</h3>

<p>
We have the following requirements:
<ul>
<li>
 the format must use ASCII,
 <li>it must be
concise enough to type by hand,
<li> it must have a  concise formal
specification,
<li> it must be expressive enough to support many types of notation and
printed formats.
</ul>

We believe that none of the existing formats address all these
requirements. For example, MusicXML cannot be typed by hand, DARMS is
limited in its application, ABC has no strict formal definition, and
NIFF is binary.  Nevertheless, this does not restrict you for using
those formats: there are filters that convert from various formats to
<tt>.ly</tt>.

<p>

<h3>LilyPond input has backslashes and braces, so it is TeX,
right?</h3>

<p>
No. The syntax is completely different. TeX is a macro language, where
the meaning of each command and each character can be
redefined. LilyPond has a structured input syntax, in the form of an
context-free grammar. As such, it is less flexible, but it is also
harder to make entry errors.
<p>
LilyPond does make use of TeX: TeX is the default output format, the
ly2dvi program uses LaTeX for formatting, and it is possible to enter
TeX macros in texts (such as lyrics).
<p>

<h3>LilyPond is about music and is related to TeX, so it is
MusicTeX?</h3>

<p>
No. There is a family of TeX macro packages (MusicTeX, MusixTeX,
OpusTeX, MuTex) for typesetting music. There is no relation between
LilyPond and any of these packages: they are not needed to run
LilyPond.
<p>

<h3>Why are you using TeX for LilyPond?</h3>
<p>
There are a couple of reasons:

<ul>
<li>LilyPond has no  mechanism for handling page breaks. This is
conveniently provided by TeX

<li>TeX is very powerful when it comes to setting text. The text for
lyrics or titling is set with TeX, so it allows for a lot of
formatting options. For example, it is possible to use foreign scripts
for the lyrics.

</ul>

LilyPond is in fact not limited to TeX. The program design allows for
other output formats. In particular, LilyPond has direct PostScript
output, but for the reasons listed here, it is not practical for real
use.
<p>

<h3>How do I learn the syntax?</h3>
<p>
For many applications, it is possible to learn the syntax by simply
looking at example files. Unfortunately, we have the impression that
this does not work well for LilyPond. For learning the language, you
are advised to work through the tutorial, which is included in the
user manual. It is pretty short, and chopped in easily digestible
chunks, and we've spent a lot of time polishing it. Please make us
happy by also using it.
<p>

<h3>Please add parameters to the input macros</h3>

<p>
LilyPond input does not have macros. It does support identifiers:
parts of the input can be given a name, and when referencing that name
contents of the identifier are substituted. However this is not a
textual substitution, rather the internal representation of that
object is pasted into the contents being parsed.
<p>

<h3>Please add macro's to the syntax.</h3>
<p>
No, we won't. Programming with text substitution (macros) lead to
horrible syntax problems. A macro programming interface is extremely
sensitive to irrelevant naming and formatting details.
<p>

<h3>
But I only need macros for simple repetitive tasks.
</h3>
<p>
Perhaps, but remember that you will probably spend more time reading
the .ly than writing. Often, a little verbosity is not such a bad
idea.  If it is only for simple things, you could just as well use
simple existing preprocessors such as CPP or M4.
<p>
Alternatively, you can use the <tt>\apply</tt> feature. This lets you
manipulate music expressions in its internal representation using the
built-in Scheme programming language.
<p>

<h3>Stop changing the syntax all the time!</h3>
<p>
We try to make LilyPond as good as possible, and that implies that we
continually improve the input format. We change the syntax whenever we
feel that it will simplify the language as a whole, or ease the
learning curve.  Keep in mind that the syntax is as great as it is now
because we also did this in the past.
<p>
Most of the language changes can be handled
running 
the program
<tt>convert-ly</tt>, which is supplied with LilyPond.  However, 
<tt>convert-ly</tt>  can only do its job if it knows what version the
original file was written for. Therefore, it is important to add
<code>version</code> statements to your files like this:
<xmp>
\version "1.3.17"
</xmp>
<p>
Changes that cannot be handled by simple edits are marked by a bump in
the major version number: converting 1.8 to 2.0 files needs
overseeing.


<h3>I don't want to learn another syntax. Now what?</h3>
<p>
There are other options: it is possible to create the music in another
format, such as ABC, ETF (From Finale) or MIDI, and then convert it to
ly format. Another option is to use a Graphical User Interface.
<p>

<h3>I want to have an intuitive User Interface!</h3>
<p>
Don't we all? We think our language is pretty intuitive once you get
the hang of it. We have not got the time to create a graphical user
interface, our task is difficult enough as it is. Luckily, other
people have filled the gap. The graphical programs NoteEdit and
RoseGarden have competent LilyPond export functions and are actively
being developed.

<p>
<h3>Help, I can't get it to install or compile. Where do I get help?</h3>
<p>
If you have a binary package which does not install correctly, or if
you have trouble while following the instructions, then send a full
bug-report to <a href="bug-lilypond@gnu.org">bug-lilypond@gnu.org</a>.
Of course you can also write to the <a
href="http://mail.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/lilypond-user">lilypond-user</a>
list for help.

<p>

<h3>Help, I can't get it to do something. Where do I get help?</h3>
<p>
You can write to the lilypond-user mailing list (which is at <a
href="http://mail.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/lilypond-user">http://mail.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/lilypond-user</a>.
It is also a good idea to check the archives of the mailing list,
which are available from <a
href="http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/lilypond-user/">http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/lilypond-user/</a>.
<p>


<h3>I think I  have found a bug.</h3>
<p>
If you have input that results in a crash or an erroneous output, then
that is a bug. We try respond to bug-reports promptly, and fix them as
soon as possible. For this, we need to replicate and isolate the
problem. Please help us by sending good bug-report: an input file that
will reproduce the problem.  Please make it small, so we can easily
isolate the problem. Don't forget to tell which version you use, and
on which platform you run it.
<p>


<h3>Could you add this feature for me?</h3>
<p>

 We will definitely read your request and think about it, 
but we set our own priorities for implementing features. If you
want us to give more attention to your request, it helps to explain
why you need it, why it is such a good idea, and to give us a
donation. <! If you really need a feature, you can also pay us to
implement it. Contact us privately for a quote.>

<p>
<h3>But it is very easy, just extend the syntax like this...</h3>
<p>

It is a tempting to think that inventing the syntax solves the
problem. In practice, less than 10% of the program is involved with
handling input and the syntax.  Almost always, adding features
involves a lot more than syntax, and is also more complicated.
