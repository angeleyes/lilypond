<h2>What's wrong with computer music notation?</h2>

We like to call LilyPond an "automated engraving system." It will
format music notation beautifully without requiring typographical
expertise of its users.

<p>

LilyPond is not unique in making music notation: there are a lot of
programs that print music, and nowadays most of the newly printed
music is made with computers.  Unfortunately, that also shows: just
ask any musician that plays classical music: new scores do not look as
nice as old (from before, say, 1970) scores: the new ones have a
bland, mechanical look. They are not at all pleasurable to play from.

<p>

To illustrate this, take a look at the following examples. Both are
editions of the 1st Cello Suite by J.S.Bach. The one on the left is a
very beautifully hand-engraved edition from 1950, the one on the right
is a typical contemporary computer product. Take a few seconds to let
the looks of both pages sink in. Which one do you like better, and
why?
<p>
<table>
<tr><td align=center>
<img src="baer-suite1-fullpage.png">
</td><td align=center>
<img src="henle-suite1-fullpage.png">
</td></tr>
<tr><td align=center>B&auml;renreiter (BA 350, (c) 1950)</td>
<td align=center>Henle (nr. 666 (c) 2000)</td>
 </tr>
</table>
<p>

The left picture looks nice: it has flowing lines and movement. It's
music, and it's alive.  Now, the picture on the right shows the same
music, and it was written by Bach.  His music surely has liveliness
and flowing lines.... Except, the score doesn't show it: it looks
rigid and mechanical.  To understand better why that is, let's blow up
a fragment of both pieces:

<p>

<img src="baer-suite1-line.png">

<p align=center> Hand-made
<p><br><p>

<img src="henle-suite1-line.png">
<p align=center>Computer-made

<p>

The location of the bar lines is a giveaway.  In the Henle edition,
both barlines are on exactly the same horizontal location. In all note
heads are also on the exact same horizontal location.  When you look
back at the whole page, you can easily verify that almost all barlines
are in the same location, as are most of the note heads. The entire
thing is spaced as if it were put to a big grid, which is what causes
the mechanical impression.

<p>

This is not the only error on this example, and more importantly, this
piece is not the only one with typographical errors.  Sadly, almost
all music printed nowadays is full of basic typographical mistakes.

<p>

Musicians are usually more absorbed with performing the music than
with studying its looks, so this nitpicking about typographical
details may seem academical. That is not justified.  This piece here
has a monotonous rhythm. If all lines look the same, they become like
a labyrinth. If the musician looks away once or has a lapse in his
concentration, he will be lost on the page.
<p>
In general, this is a common characteristic of typography. Layout
should be pretty, not only for its own sake, but especially because it
helps the reader in his task. For performance material like sheet
music, this is doubly important: musicians have a limited amount of
attention. The less attention they need for reading, the more they can
focus on playing itself.  In other words, better typography translates
to better performances.
<p>


<h2>What's wrong with music notation software</h2>
<p>
Computer music print outs do not look good.  According to us, this
caused by inadequate software. In other words, programmers have been
doing a shoddy job on notation programs.  To illustrate that, we have
a piece of music, which was made in Finale 2003, one of the most
popular `professional' notation programs sold today. It was made with
all of the default settings. The music is from the Sarabande of the
2nd Cello Suite by J. S. Bach.

<p align="center" >

<p> 

This example far surpasses the previous one when it comes to
formatting errors: there are serious errors in literally
<em>every</em> measure. The errors come in all sizes: a big one is the
oddly s p a c e d &nbsp o u t last line. A smaller one is the flat in
measure 13, which is covered by the note preceding it. Here is a
magnification of that measure: <p align="center" > <img align="center"
src="finale-flat-detail.png">
<p>
The errors go down to the teensy details: below is a blowup of the
beam in that measure. Of course, in proper typography the beam should
not stick out to the right of the stem, and the ribbles provide a
telling glimpse into Coda Music Technology programmers' aptness (or
lack thereof) with the underlying PostScript technology.

<p align="center" >
<img  src="finale-beam-detail.png">
<p>

Now, one could refute that Finale has a graphical interface, and it
lets you easily move about elements to correct errors, or use plug-ins
to do so.  This is certainly true: in fact, good professional
engravers that use Finale typically spend the majority of their time
correcting all the errors that Finale routinely makes.  Do you want to
spend your time correcting pretty obvious errors?  For the spaced out
line, it is doable, but imagine that you have to correct each and
every beam that sticks out of the stems....  by hand?

<p>
There is a less obvious reason why correcting things by hand is a bad
idea. Consider again measure 13 reproduced above.  The misplaced flat
is pretty obvious, but did you notice that repeat bar? Its lines are
too far apart. Did you notice that the eighth rest is too far down?
Did it occur to you that the stem of the last eighth note is too long?
<p align="center" >
<img src="finale-flat-correct.png">
<p>
Unless you are an expert, typographical errors will --at best-- irk
you without being obvious. At worst, they go unnoticed and still be in
the final print.

<p>

This is one example may seem contrived, but in fact, it's not.  All
major producers of notation software claim to follow engraving
standards, but all of them make systemic mistakes.  If you want to
assess the output of your favorite program, then buy a decent
hand-made score from a respectable publisher, and try to reproduce one
page of it. Then compare them:

<ul>
<li>
How does the page layout compare? Typically, computer scores are more
widely spaced so they take up more pages, meaning more annoying page
turns.

<li>
How does the spacing compare?  Is it as lively and flowing as the
hand-made score? If in doubt, try measuring both with a ruler.

<li>
Put both on a music stand, 1 meter away, that is not uncommon when
performing. Can you read both pages? Almost all computer scores have
an anemic look: they use lines which are too thin, and symbols which
are too light. That makes them hard to read from a distance. If in
doubt, measure the difference with a magnifying glass.

</ul>

<p>

<h2>Better music notation software</h2>
<p>

Most notation software needs babysitting to produce acceptable output.
In our opinion, all this tweaking and tuning is something that a
computer should do for you.

<p>


Our goal with <em>LilyPond</em> is to write an an <em>automated
engraving system</em>: a system that will produce beautiful music
("engraving") automatically.  In concept, such a system is simple: the
objective of such a system is to produce music notation, a graphical
image.  The content of this picture is music: pitches and
durations. In automated system, we want to generate the form from the
content, so schematically, the program could be represented as

<table>
<tr>
<td align="center">
<img src="simple-notation.png">

<td align="center">
&lt;--

<td align="center">

<h2>Music notation</h2>

<p>

In theory, this design is easy, but how do we put it to practice?
Common music notation encompasses some 500 years of music. Its
applications range from a simple rhythms for single instruments to
monstruous counterpoint for large orchestras.

<p>

How can we get a grip on such a many-headed beast?  A first solution
is to make a strict distinction between notation, <em>what</em>
symbols to use, and engraving, <em>where</em> to put them.  For
tackling notation, we have broken up the problem into digestible (and
programmable) chunks: every type of symbol is handled by a separate
plugin.  All plugins cooperate through the LilyPond architecture.
They are completely modular and independent, so each can be developed
and improved separately.
<p>
The most basic plug-in creates Note-heads:

<p align=center> 
<img src=engraver-noteheads.png>
<p>
This plug-in creates graphical objects from musical events.  People
that put graphics to musical ideas are called copyists or engravers,
so by analogy, this plug-in is called <tt>Note_head_engraver</tt>.

<p> Note heads must be put on a staff to
make sense, hence we add the <tt>Staff_symbol_engraver</tt>, which
generates the object representing the staff lines.  <p align=center>
<img src=engraver-staff.png>

<p>
The note heads have no meaningful pitches without a clef.  The
<tt>Clef_engraver</tt> tells <tt>Note_head_engraver</tt> how high each
head should be placed.

<p align=center> 
<img src=engraver-clef.png>
<p>
For the flags and stems we  a <tt>Stem_engraver</tt>:
<p align=center> 
<img src=engraver-stem.png>
<p>
This engraver is notified of any note head coming along.  Every time
one (or more, for a chord) note heads is seen, a stem object is
created, and attached to the note head.
<p>
Similarly, beams, slurs, accents are handled by separate engravers,
that create objects and connect them to stems, note heads, etc.:

<p
align=center> <img src=engraver-slur.png>
<p>

Accidentals are also handled by a separate plug-in: for every note
outside of the key-signature, an accidental object is created, and
connected to the note. It needs the cooperation of
<tt>Key_signature_engraver</tt> that makes the key signature at the
start of the line. For good measure, we also throw in a
<tt>Bar_line_engraver</tt> and <tt>Time_signature_engraver</tt>

<p align=center>
<img src=engraver-acc.png>

<h2> Polyphonic notation</h2>

The system shown in the last section works well for monophonic music,
but what about polyphony?  In polyphonic notation, many voices can
share a staff:
<p align=center>
<img src=engraver-final.png>
<p>
In this situation, the accidentals and staff are shared, but the
stems, slurs, beams, etc. are private to each voice. Hence, engravers
should be grouped.  The engravers for note head, stems, slurs, etc. go
into a group called "Voice context," while the engravers for key,
accidental, bar, etc. go into a group called "Staff context."  In the
case of polyphony, a single Staff context contains more than one Voice
context.  Similarly, more Staff contexts can be put into a single
Score context:

<h2>Music engraving</h2>

<img src="hader-slaan.jpg" align="right">
The second problem is that of music engraving: the art of placing
symbols such that the result looks pleasing.  The term music engraving
derives from the traditional process of music printing.  Only a few
decades ago, sheet music was made by cutting and stamping the music
into zinc or pewter plates, in mirror image.   The plate would be inked, and the depressions caused by
the cutting and stamping would hold ink.  An image was formed by
pressing paper to the plate. The stamping and cutting was completely
done by hand. Making corrections was cumbersome, so engraving had to
be done correctly in one go. Of course, this was a highly specialized
skill


<ul>
<li> Music engraving is a traditional craft, and was learned in
practice. An accomplished master had to complete around 10 years of
practice.

<li> Most of the knowledge was passed from master to apprentice during
practical training. Consequently, little has been explicitly laid down
about the rules of elegant engraving.

<li> Finally, engraving is about selecting proper distance and
blackness for scores. <img align=right src="stone-distance.png"> The
quality of the end result must judged visually. This is virtually
impossible to capture in formal rules.

</ul>

<h2>Implementing typography</h2>

<p>
If craftsmen need over ten years to become true masters, how could we
simple hackers ever write a program to take over their jobs?
<p>
The answer is: we cannot! At least, not in one go.

<p>
Instead, we try to gradually refine the program: we implement a
feature, we start with a half-baked solution that might cover 75% of
the cases badly, but as we continue development of the program, these
solutions are replaced and refined, so that we provide better and
better formatting, and getting 85, 90 or even 95 % of the cases
correct. The remaining 15, 10, or 5 % of the cases must be
adjusted by hand.

<p>
This is only possible if the program is modular enough to allow
development of such a kind: formatting rules are constantly refined or
replaced to improve the program, and and the user must be able to
override all formatting decisions. Hence, we need an architecture
where rules and decisions can be changed on the fly.
<p>
This architecture is formed by <a href=http://www.gnu.org>GUILE</a>,
an interpreter for the LISP-like programming language Scheme.  Layout
objects representing note heads, slurs, accidentals, etc. carry
variables.  Formatting rules (Scheme functions) are stored in these
variables. In the following example, the function that produces a note
head is changed on the fly, while the rest of the formatting is
unaltered:


<p align=center>
<img src="mc-squared.png">
<p>

Distances, directions and thicknesses, i.e. formatting decisions, are
also stored in variables.  By changing these, the typographical style
of a score may be altered. In the next example, the thickness of the
stem is increased for every note:

<p align=center> 
<img src="mc-squared-stem-thick.png">
<p>





<hr>

<p>
A second difference is in the blackness of the page: the
B&auml;renreiter has a stronger look, simply because it uses a heavier
font, and thicker staff lines. This is also easily visible
when you look at blowups of the scores:
