LilyPond is a batch program, so you run it from the command line.  An
actual screenshot is not all that interesting, it looks something like: 

<blockquote>
<font size="-1">
<pre>
ly2dvi (GNU LilyPond) 1.7.5
Running lilypond...
GNU LilyPond 1.7.11
Now processing: `input/example-1.ly'
Parsing...
Interpreting music...[3]
Preprocessing elements... 
Calculating column positions... 
paper output to `example-1.tex'...

Interpreting music...
MIDI output to `example-1.midi'...
Track ... 

Analyzing example-1.tex...
Running latex...
DVI output to `example-1.dvi'...
MIDI output to `example-1.midi'...
</pre>
</font></blockquote>

Much more interesting are samples of what you can do with the
program. For this, check out the samples that are included with the
current LilyPond versions. They are available <a

<p>
The website of the <a href=http://www.mutopiaproject.org>mutopia
project</a> holds more extensive examples of classical music.

Some samples of more recent music are ..TODO..
