<h1>Features of LilyPond</h1>

<h2>Music language input.</h2>
<p>
 The  input is done in the form of a textual music language.
 
  <ul>
   <li> Entry may be done with the text editor of your choice, and using
    the national language of your choice.

<li>The ASCII input language can integrate with TeX, HTML and Texinfo,
thus allowing musicological treatises to be written from a single
source.  

<li> The music and its layout are strictly separated, so score and
parts (possibly in different styles and keys) and scores can be
generated from the same source, and changes always take effect in both
places

<li>The output can be improved by upgrading the program.
 
<li>Pieces can be printed in different (typographical) house styles,
or according to different notational conventions.
   
</ul>

<h2>Automated high-quality formatting.</h2>

<ul>
 <li> Automatic  spacing, line breaking and page breaking

 <li>
Handling of polyphonic collisions for notes, dots, and  rests 

<li> Automatic placement of accidentals, beams, slurs. 

  <li>
   Users don't need  typographical expertise to produce good notation.
   
  <li>No user interaction necessary during running, Running the
   program can be automated, which is convenient for mass converting
   databases of digitized music, and printing algorithmic
   compositions.
  
<li>
 The Feta font has been tailored especially for LilyPond, and was
 designed carefully mimicking the finest hand-engraved scores.
 It is available as a scalable font, but also as a Metafont.
    
<li> Support for many notation constructs.
</ul>
