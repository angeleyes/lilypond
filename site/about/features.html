<h1>Features of LilyPond</h1>

<ul>

  <li>Music language input.

<p>
 The  input is done in the form of a textual music language. This has
 the following benefits:
 
 <ul>
 <li> Entry may be done with the text editor of your choice, and using
 the national language of your choice.
 <li>The ASCII input language can integrate with TeX, HTML and
 Texinfo, thus allowing musicological treatises to be written from a
 single source.
</ul><p>


<li>  Separation of form and content.

The music language ensures that content (the music) and the layout are
strictly separated. This paradigm has the following advantages
<p>
<ul>
<li> Parts and scores can be generated from the same source:
changes  always take effect in both places

 <li> Parts in different styles and keys may be printed from the same
 source. Changes in the source always take effect in all versions.

 <li>The output can be improved by upgrading the program.
  </ul>
<p>

  <li> Automated formatting.
<p>
 Formatting of collisions, accidentals, beams, slurs, ties, note head
 and polyphonic chord collisions, spacing, line breaking is
 automated. This has numerous benefits:
   
  <ul>
  <li>
   Users don't need  typographical expertise to produce good notation.
   
  <li>No user interaction necessary during running
  
  <li> Running the program can be automated, which is convenient for
  mass converting  databases of digitized music, and printing
  algorithmic compositions.
  
  </ul><p>


  <li>Libre Software
<p>
  LilyPond is available under the GNU GPL. This means that it is
  available at no cost. More importantly, you have the freedom to fix,
  modify and extend the program, or you can pay someone else to do so.

 <li> Scheme scripting interface.
<p>

 Users can extend the program by using the builting Scheme
 interpreter.  Such Scheme functions provide a plug-in functionality,
 and they can be as powerful as the built-in functionality.

 <li> Extensible style sheet support.

 <p>

 All formatting parameters are in a style sheet. This style sheet can
 be globally changed, or for a single piece, or even single measures
 or notes. All these overrides are subsumed in a single framework for
 tuning the style-sheet.  The style sheet contains all fixed distances
 and line thicknesses.

 <li> Custom font.
<p>
 The Feta font has been tailored especially for LilyPond, and was
 designed carefully mimicking the finest hand-engraved scores.
 It is available as a scalable font, but also as a Metafont.
    
 <li> Support for many notation constructs.
<p>
LilyPond supports many different forms of music notation

<ul>

<li>
Chord names. Chord names can be printed in different styles, for
example with German note names, and may be transposed to other keys.

<li> Drum notation  support.
 <li> Figured bass support.
 <li> Grace notes.

 <li> Basic support for tablature notation.  Fret numbers are
  determined automatically, and the string tuning and number of
  strings may be adjusted.

  <li>Modern notation. Lilypond provides cluster notation and rhythmic
  grouping.

   <li> Tremolos, both for single notes and chords.
  <li> Tuplets in arbitrary ratios, which can be nested.

</ul><p>

  <li> PostScript output.

PostScript output is generated via the TeX typesetting system. The
output can be postprocessed to produce PDF, or images for use on the
web.
   
 <li>Conforms to the GNU Coding standards.
<p>

 There are no arbitrary limits on the number of staves, voices,
 measures, lengths of texts,  etc.
<li>Runs on Unix.
<p>

LilyPond runs on all major platforms: All Unix variants including
Linux and MacOS X, as well as MS Windows, using the Cygwin environment.

<li>
Extensive documentation.
<p>
LilyPond is accompanied by a 170 page manual, 400 small examples.  The
Mutopia project provides over 300 larger examples, including opera
scores and piano albums.  The program internals are automatically
documented in a special reference manual.


<li>
Active user community.

<p>
LilyPond is supported through mailing lists which have fostered an
active community of users that help new users with their problems.
The developers monitor these lists to assist with difficult questions
and to stay in touch with the wishes of the user-community.

<li>
Instant bugfixes
<p>
The developers have a policy of promptly and actively responding to
bugreports. LilyPond should be "bug free."

<li>
Support by and for third party programs.
<p>
LilyPond is exported from the RoseGarden and NoteEdit GUIs. LilyPond
can import ABC, ETF and MIDI.
