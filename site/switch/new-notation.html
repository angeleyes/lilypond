<title>Strange Notation</title>


<body>
With a focus on classic notation, you might wonder whether LilyPond is
suited for modern music. Fortunately, the answer is a resounding
<b>yes</b>.


<h2>&ldquo;Look ma, no hacks!&rdquo;</h2>

If you generate music with software, publishing it is as easy as
writing simple ASCII files. If you do <em>avant-garde</em> music then
you will love Lily's flexibility with measures and time
signatures. Here is a sample with nested tuplets. The spacing is
exactly proportional to the duration of each note.  Notes don't have
to fill measures, and two notes are only aligned only if they start
exactly together.

In any other program, getting this output requires massive ad-hoc
fiddling and tweaking. In LilyPond, one simply enters the notes, with
their rhythmic structure,

<blockquote>

<pre>
\times 7/9 {
  \times 4/6 {
     r8 c32[ c c c c c c c] r4
     c32[ c32 c16
  }
  \times 5/4 {
    c16 c c] c32[ c32 c16 c] r8
  }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

If you are familiar with the programming language Scheme, you can even
compose algorithmically inside LilyPond!

Need anything non-standard?  With a small twist, you can use Lily's
unlimited flexibility to make <a

<h2>Graphics editing</h2>

If that's not enough, you can always make Lily write an SVG file, and
edit the final result in an SVG editor, such as <a
