<h1>Why switch to LilyPond?</h1>

LilyPond is better music notation software.

<h2>Text-based input</h2>
<p>
LilyPond takes ASCII input, which you can produce in <em>your</em>
favorite environment, quickly and comfortably.  No more futzing with
the mouse.  The input contains all the information, so there is no
need to remember complex command sequences. Simply save an input for
later reference.  With the lilypond-book utitility, you can also
integrate music into LaTeX or HTML seamlessly. Create books with music
fragments, from a single source file!

<p>
Part extraction is done automatically (<a href="howto.html#orchestral">demo</a>).  The input file contains the
music itself. Since parts and score are generated from the same
source, they are always in sync. In addition, LilyPond can combine
staves in scores and insert cue-notes from other parts.


<h2>High-quality automated layout</h2>

We put our expertise is in the program, so you do not have to worry
about layout. LilyPond produces ready-to-print PDF files, determining
spacing by itself and breaking lines to provide tight but uniform page
layout.  Clashes between lyrics, notes, and chords are resolved and
slurs and beams are sloped, <em>automatically</em>!

<p>

All style settings, font designs and algorithms have been inspired by
the finest hand-engraved music. LilyPond output has that same strong
and balanced look as a classical scores. (<a

All settings can be changed to suit your personal typographical
taste. If that still is not enough, there is always the built-in
scripting language, a dialect of the powerful language LISP.
Settings, variables and functions are all documented in the
comprehensive program reference manual.
