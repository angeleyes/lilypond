  <dt>Text-based input</dt>
  <dd>
    LilyPond takes ASCII input, which you can produce in <em>your</em>
    favorite environment, quickly and comfortably.  No more futzing with
    the mouse.  The input contains all the information, so there is no
    need to remember complex command sequences.  Simply save an input for
    later reference.
  </dd>

  <dt>Mix music and text</dt>
  <dd>
    With the lilypond-book utitility, you can
    integrate music into LaTeX or HTML seamlessly.  Create books with
    music fragments, from a single source file!
  </dd>

  <dt>Even better than part extraction!</dt>
  <dd>
    The input file contains the music itself.  Since parts and score are
    generated from the same source, they are always in sync
    (<a href="howto.html#orchestral">demo</a>).  In addition, LilyPond can
    combine staves in scores and insert cue-notes from other parts.
  </dd>

  <dt>Automated layout</dt>
  <dd>
    We put our expertise is in the program, so tuning output is almost
    never necessary.  LilyPond determines spacing by itself, and breaks
    lines and pages to provide tight but uniform layout.  Clashes between
    lyrics, notes, and chords are resolved and slurs and beams are sloped,
    <em>automatically</em>!

  <dt>Finest classical engraving available</dt>
  <img src="@IMAGES@flat-design.png" align="right">
  <dd>
    All style settings, font designs and algorithms have been inspired by
    the finest hand-engraved music.  LilyPond output has that same strong
    and balanced look as a classical scores.

  <dt>Libre software</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      How much it costs?  Nada, zilch, nothing!  Yep - It's free.  Get
      it from the <a href="../download">download page</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover it's also free (as in "speech") software.  It comes with
      source code, and permission to change and copy it.  So, are you
      irritated by a bug, or yearning for a feature?  Simply add it
      yourself, or pay someone else to do it.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Extensible design</dt>
  <dd>
    All settings can be changed to suit your personal typographical
    taste.  If that still is not enough, there is always the built-in
    scripting language, a dialect of the powerful language LISP.
    Settings, variables and functions are all documented in the
    comprehensive program reference manual.
  </dd>

  <dt>Excellent support</dt>
  <dd>
    LilyPond runs on all popular platforms: Linux, MacOS X, and Windows.
    LilyPond comes with a 230 page user manual and 400 example
    files.  There is an active user community answering questions on the
    <a href="http://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.lilypond.general">Lilypond
      user</a> mailing list, while the
