<h1>Why switch to LilyPond?</h1>

LilyPond is a different, better way of printing music.
<p>

<h2>Text-based input</h2>
<p>
LilyPond takes ASCII input, which you can produce in <em>your</em>
favorite environment, quickly and comfortably.  No more futzing with
the mouse.  The input contains all the information, so there is no
need to remember complex command sequences. Simply save an input for
later reference.  With lilypond-book, you can also integrate music
into LaTeX seamlessly: write music books without cutting and pasting
pictures of EPS files.

<p>
<! TODO: should have a diagram with the .ly , and two arrows to part &
score. > The input file contains the music itself. Parts and score are
generated from that one file, so both are always up to date: update
the music, and parts and score change  along.


<h2>Automated layout</h2>

We put our expertise is in the program, so you do not have to worry
about layout. LilyPond will format scores for you, determining spacing
by itself, breaking lines automatically to provide tight but uniform
page layout.  Clashes between lyrics, notes, and chords are resolved
automatically.
<p>
In fact, Lily is so automatic, that you can run it in batch: let it
run overnight to mass convert entire data bases of music scores.


<h2>Libre software</h2>

<p>
How much it costs? Nada, zilch, nothing! Yep - It's free. Just
download it <a href="../download">here</a>.

<p>
Even more importantly, it's also free (as in "speech") software: it
comes with source code, and permission to change and copy it. So, are
you irritated by a bug, or yearning for a feature?  Simply add it
yourself, or pay someone else to do it.

<h2>High quality layout</h2>

All style settings, font designs and algorithms have been inspired by
the finest hand-engraved music. LilyPond output has that
same strong and balanced look.

<h2>Extensible design</h2>
<p>
All settings can be changed to suit your personal typographical
taste. If that still is not enough, there is always the built-in
scripting language, a dialect of the powerful language LISP.
Settings, variables and functions are all documented in the
comprehensive program reference manual.
