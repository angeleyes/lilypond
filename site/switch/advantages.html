  <dt>Text-based input</dt>
  <dd>
    LilyPond takes ASCII input, which you can produce in <em>your</em>
    favorite environment, quickly and comfortably.  No more futzing with
    the mouse.  The input contains all the information, so there is no
    need to remember complex command sequences.  Simply save an input for
    later reference.
  </dd>

  <dt>Mix music and text</dt> <dd>

  Put fragments of music into texts with without cutting and pasting
  pictures. With the <tt>lilypond-book</tt> utitility, you can
  integrate music into LaTeX or HTML seamlessly.  </dd>

  
  <dt>Excellent results without fiddling</dt>

  <dd>
   Don't waste time with tweaking the output; LilyPond gets the
  formatting correct right from the start.  It determines spacing by
  itself, and breaks lines and pages to provide a tight and uniform
  layout.  Clashes between lyrics, notes, and chords are resolved and
  slurs and beams are sloped, <em>automatically</em>!
  </dd>

  <dt>Even better than part extraction!</dt>

    <dd>
    Parts and score are made from the same source file, so every
    change always gets into both score and parts.  (<a
    href="howto.html#orchestral">demo</a>).  In addition, LilyPond can
    combine staves in scores and insert cue-notes from other parts.

  <dt>Finest classical engraving available</dt>
  <dd>
    <img src="@IMAGES@flat-design.png" align="right" alt="flat-design">

    All style settings, font designs and algorithms have been inspired
    by the finest hand-engraved music.  LilyPond output has that same
    strong and balanced look as a classical score.  (<a

  <dt>Libre software</dt>
  <dd>
      How much it costs?  Nada, zilch, nothing!  Yep - It's free.  Get
      it from the <a href="../install">download page</a>.
    <p>
      Moreover it's also free (as in "speech") software.  It comes with
      source code, and permission to change and copy it.  So, are you
      irritated by a bug, or yearning for a feature?  Simply add it
      yourself, or pay someone else to do it.

  <dt>Extensible design</dt>
  <dd>
    All settings can be changed to suit your personal typographical
    taste.  If that still is not enough, there is always the built-in
    scripting language, a dialect of the powerful language LISP.
    Settings, variables and functions are all documented in the
    comprehensive program reference manual.
  </dd>

    files.  There is an active user community answering questions on the
