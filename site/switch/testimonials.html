  &ldquo;... I've written a couple of encore pieces for solo cello
  which I've printed with LilyPond and which I'm going to submit to
  Schirmer for publication. I'll bet their engraved version wouldn't
  look half as sharp as mine!&rdquo;

  &ldquo;Although I don't know [LilyPond] very well yet, I'm *very*
  impressed. I used the program to input a motet of Josquin Desprez in
  mensural notation and there's no doubt that lilypond outscores all
  other notation programs easily concerning speed, ease of use and
  look!&rdquo;

  &ldquo; [..after the first orchestra rehearsal] I got numerous
  compliments about the quality of the scores.  Even more importantly,
  while Lilypond provides numerous hacks to improve the way its scores
  look, what the orchestra got from me is basically the raw, untouched
  output.  &rdquo;

<p>
  &ldquo;thanks and kudos to the development team for their incredible
  work. I've never seen anything approaching the output that I get
  from Lilypond -- I'm totally confident that my music publishing
  needs will be fulfilled beyond my expectations using this great
  application. [..]  basically untweaked Lilypond output [..] looks
  better than most recent "professional" publications I've compared it
  to (q.v., just about any Warner Bros. score, and even many of the
  most recent by "the old houses"). [..]

  &ldquo;I think that Lilypond is already ready for "prime time" -- I've used it
  for two years in a university music composition course, thereby saving
  me hundreds of dollars (or whatever the "cheap" student versions of Finale or
  Sibelius costs).  And some people exclaim "wow!  How did you get Finale to
  make music that looks so good?"&rdquo;

  &ldquo;I had a kind of hate-passion relationship with it. Passion because
  the first score I saw was so amazing! The description of LilyPond
  lies about its beautifulness, it is too modest! 
  [..] as LilyPond is getting always better, and as I look
  closer how things are done in scheme, I have less and less
  frustrations. Anyway, what I mean is: thank you for providing
  LilyPond, it is really good.&rdquo;

<p>
  i think [LilyPond is] an incredible
  program, and it produces wonderful, wonderful output. when i read an
  interview about it last year, i was raving to several friends of mine
  about its potential

<h2>Why all the praise?</h2>

<p>
  LilyPond closely mimics the looks of hand-engraved music, while most
  other programs don't.  If you want to understand this difference (or
  if you simply are interested), then read our treatise on
  <a href="../about/automated-engraving/"> automated music engraving</a>.

<p>
  Of course, you can also continue with seeing LilyPond
