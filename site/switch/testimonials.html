&ldquo;... I've written a couple of encore pieces for solo cello which I've
printed with LilyPond and which I'm going to submit to Schirmer for
publication. I'll bet their engraved version wouldn't look half as
sharp as mine!&rdquo;

	&ldquo;thanks and kudos to the development team for their incredible
	work. I've never seen anything approaching the output that I get from
	Lilypond -- I'm totally confident that my music publishing needs will
	be fulfilled beyond my expectations using this great application. [..]
	basically untweaked Lilypond output [..] looks better than most recent
	"professional" publications I've compared it to (q.v., just about any
	Warner Bros. score, and even many of the most recent by "the old
	houses"). [..]<p> Beat that, Finale/Sibelius/Igor/whatever!!!&rdquo;

&ldquo;I think that Lilypond is already ready for "prime time" -- I've used it
for two years in a university music composition course, thereby saving
me hundreds of dollars (or whatever the "cheap" student versions of Finale or
Sibelius costs).  And some people exclaim "wow!  How did you get Finale to
make music that looks so good?"&rdquo;

&ldquo;Lilypond is obviously the zillion-ton gorilla [of great music
typesetting].&rdquo;

&ldquo;I think Lilypond is great [..]  The more I learn about LilyPond the
more I like it!&rdquo;

&ldquo;I had a kind of hate-passion relationship with it. Passion because
 the first score I saw was so amazing! The description of LilyPond
 lies about its beautifulness, it is too modest! 
 [..] as LilyPond is getting always better, and as I look
 closer how things are done in scheme, I have less and less
 frustrations. Anyway, what I mean is: thank you for providing
 LilyPond, it is really good.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Anyway, LilyPond does an amazingly good job -- and the input files
are *really* small: 17kByte for 5 pages of fairly complicated modern
music is terrific!&rdquo;

<h2>Why all the praise?</h2>

<p>
LilyPond closely mimics the looks of hand-engraved music, and a lot
of other programs don't.  If you want to understand this difference
(or if you simply are interested), then read our treatise on <a
