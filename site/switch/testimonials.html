``... I've written a couple of encore pieces for solo cello which I've
printed with LilyPond and which I'm going to submit to Schirmer for
publication. I'll bet their engraved version wouldn't look half as
sharp as mine!''

``Anyway, LilyPond does an amazingly good job -- and the input files
are *really* small: 17kByte for 5 pages of fairly complicated modern
music is terrific!''

``Lilypond is obviously the zillion-ton gorilla [of great music
typesetting].''

``I think Lilypond is great [..]  The more I learn about LilyPond the
more I like it!''

``I had a kind of hate-passion relationship with it. Passion because
 the first score I saw was so amazing! The description of LilyPond
 lies about its beautifulness, it is too modest! 
 [..] as LilyPond is getting always better, and as I look
 closer how things are done in scheme, I have less and less
 frustrations. Anyway, what I mean is: thank you for providing
 LilyPond, it is really good.''

``I think that Lilypond is already ready for "prime time" -- I've used it
for two years in a university music composition course, thereby saving
me $300 (or whatever the "cheap" student version of Finale or Sibelius
costs).  And some people have exclaimed "wow!  How did you get Finale to
make music that looks so good?"''
