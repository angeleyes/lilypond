<h2>LilyPond in practice</h2>

<p>
  With LilyPond we have tried to make engraving available for everyone,
  so what can you do with it in practice?
</p>

<h3>Lead sheets</h3>

<p>
  One of the things you can typeset is pop music.  Here is an example:
</p>

<p align="center">
  <a href="@IMAGES@sondag-morgen.png" title="Click to enlarge">
    <img width="450" src="@IMAGES@sondag-morgen-smaller.png"></a>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>Click image to enlarge</em>
</p>

<p>
  This example shows chord names, drum notation and tablature in action.
  Note the polyphonic notation for the horn section, and note how the
  chords (The "Em7" and "Hm7" printed at the top) use Danish chord
  names. The latter simply is a layout option.  By switching back a
  toggle, you can print English chord names.
</p>

<h3>Classical music</h3>

<p>
  Our work on LilyPond is inspired by classical engraving, so 
  classical music is no problem. Simple solo-pieces are set in a breeze,

<p>
  and with a little work, complex pieces are also possible

</p>

<p>
  More samples of the latest LilyPond versions are included in the
  documentation pages.  There are separate pages for the
  <a href="@DOC@v2.4/examples.html">stable</a> and for the
  <a href="@DOC@v2.5/examples.html">development</a> release.
</p>

<h3>Collect music on-line</h3>

<p>
  LilyPond is libre and free, so it is a safe format for exchanging and
  archiving music.  If a composer has been dead for more than 70 years,
  then his/her music is in the Public Domain.  It may freely be put into
  (digital) libraries.  This is what the
  <a href="http://www.mutopiaproject.org">Mutopia project</a> is about: a
  collection of music, typeset in LilyPond.
</p>

<p align="center">
  <a href="http://www.mutopiaproject.org"><img src="@IMAGES@mutopia.png"></a>
</p>

<p>
  All the music on Mutopia is in the  public domain, so you can download and
  print it without costs.  If you're not satisfied, then add other fingerings,
  transpose it, or use it in your own compositions. 
</p>

<h3>Print databases</h3>

<p>
  LilyPond is a batch program: you don't have to be there while running
  it.  It can easily be scripted to convert complete databases of music
  automatically.  One example is
  <a href="http://sniff.numachi.com/~rickheit/dtrad/">Yet Another
    Digital Tradition Page</a>,
  which uses LilyPond to produce sheet music for approximately 9000
  folk songs. Here is another one.  The Computer Science department at
  Utrecht University has an online
  <a href="http://teuge.labs.cs.uu.nl/Rntt/mir/mir.cgi?pwd=none">search
  service</a>,
  with almost half a million music fragments for music
  retrieval research.  LilyPond's automated engraving provided
  notation for all of them.
