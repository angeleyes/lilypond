<h2>LilyPond in practice</h2>

<p>
  With LilyPond we have tried to make the most beautiful music
  typography available for everyone. Let's see what that
  means in practice.
</p>

<h3>Lead sheets</h3>

<p>
  One of the things you can typeset is pop music.  Here is an example:
</p>

<p align="center">
  <a href="@IMAGES@sondag-morgen.png" title="Click to enlarge">
    <img width="450" src="@IMAGES@sondag-morgen-smaller.png"
	 alt="sondag-morgen">
  </a>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>Click image to enlarge</em>
</p>

<p>
  This example shows chord names, drum notation and tablature in action.
  Note the polyphonic notation for the horn section, and note how the
  chords (The "Em7" and "Hm7" printed at the top) use Danish chord
  names. The latter simply is a layout option.  By switching back a
  toggle, you can print English chord names.
</p>

<h3>Classical music</h3>

<p>
  Our work on LilyPond is inspired by classical engraving, so 
  classical music is no problem. Simple solo pieces are set in a breeze,

  </a>
</p>

</p>

<p>
  and with a little work, complex pieces are also possible
</p>

<p align="center">
  <a href="@DOC@stable/input/les-nereides.pdf"
     title="Click for a PDF file">
    <img src="@IMAGES@les-nereides.png" alt="les-nereides"></a>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>(Click image for a PDF file)</em>
</p>

<p>
  More samples of the latest LilyPond versions are included in the
  documentation pages.  There are separate pages for the
  <a href="@DOC@stable/examples.html">stable</a> and for the
  <a href="@DOC@latest/examples.html">development</a> release.
</p>

<h3>Modern music</h3>

With its ASCII interface and flexible design, LilyPond is uniquely
suited for various <a href="new-notation.html">modern music and
non-standard notation</a>.

<h3>Collect music on-line</h3>

<p>
  LilyPond is free (as in &ldquo;freedom&rdquo;), so it is a safe
  format for exchanging and archiving music.  If a composer died more
  than 70 years ago, then his music is in the Public Domain.  It may
  freely be put into (digital) libraries.  This is what the <a
  href="http://www.mutopiaproject.org">Mutopia project</a> is about: a
  collection of music, typeset in LilyPond.
</p>

<p align="center">
  <a href="http://www.mutopiaproject.org">
    <img src="@IMAGES@mutopia.png" alt="mutopia">
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  All the music on Mutopia is in the  public domain, so you can download and
  print it without costs.  If you're not satisfied, then add other fingerings,
  transpose it, or use it in your own compositions. 
</p>

<h3>Print databases</h3>

<p>
  LilyPond can run unattended.  For example, it can easily be scripted
  to convert complete databases of music automatically.  One example
  is the Computer Science department at Utrecht University, with an
  online <a
  href="http://teuge.labs.cs.uu.nl/Rntt/mir/mir.cgi?pwd=none">search
  service</a>, with almost half a million music fragments for music
  retrieval research.  LilyPond's automated engraving provided
  notation for all of them.
