<h2>LilyPond in practice</h2>


<p>

With LilyPond we have tried to make engraving available for everyone,
but what does that mean in practice? In other words, what can you do
with it?

<p>


<h3>Lead sheets</h3>
<p>
One of the things you can typeset is pop music. Here is an example:

This example shows chord names, drum notation and tablature in action.
Note the polyphonic notation for the horn section, and note how the
chords (The "Em7" and "Hm7" printed at the top) use Danish chord
names. The latter simply is a layout option.  By switching back a
toggle, you can print normal American chord names.

<h3>Classical music</h3>
<p>
Since our work on LilyPond is inspired by classical engraving, so 
classical music is no problem:

Some more samples of the latest LilyPond versions are included in the
documentation pages. There are separate pages for the <a
href=http://lilypond.org/doc/v1.8/examples.html>stable</a> and for the
a href=http://lilypond.org/doc/v1.8/examples.html>development</a>
release.


<h3>Collect music on-line</h3>
<p>
LilyPond is libre and free, so it is a safe format for exchanging and
archiving music. If a composer has been dead for more than 70 years,
then his/her music is in the Public Domain.  It may freely be put into
(digital) libraries.  This is what the <a
href="http://www.mutopiaproject.org">Mutopia project</a> is about: a
collection of music, typeset in LilyPond.

<p>

All the music on Mutopia is in the  public domain, so you can download and
print it without costs. If you're not satisfied, add other fingerings,
transpose it, or use it in your own compositions. 


<h3>Print databases</h3>
<p>
LilyPond is a batch program: you don't have to be there while running
it.  It can easily be scripted to convert complete databases of music
automatically. One example is <a
href="http://sniff.numachi.com/~rickheit/dtrad/">Yet Another Digital
Tradition Page</a>, which uses LilyPond to produce sheet music for
approximately 9000 folk songs. Here is another one: LilyPond's
automated engraving provided notation for half a million (to be
precise: 476000) fragments of music:
