Beautiful music deserves beautiful layout. Your music deserves it. All
music deserves it. Seven years ago, we set out to capture the rules of
music engraving in a program: a machine may be mechanic, but why
should its products be? Our quest and our answer are embodied in
LilyPond. It prints music beautifully, and we built it like we expect
software to be: robust, open and flexible.

<p>Share and enjoy!
