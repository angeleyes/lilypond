  &ldquo;The name is Pond...<br>
  LilyPond&rdquo;</h1>

    &ldquo;A thing of beauty is a joy forever&rdquo;

    --John Keats</em>
</p>

<p>
  The inspiration for LilyPond came when two befriended musicians got
  annoyed with the bland and boring look of computer print-outs.
  Every musician prefers reading beautiful music, so couldn't we
  programmers solve that printing problem?
</p>
<p>
  LilyPond just does that: it prints music in the best traditions of
  classical engraving with minimum fuss. Don't waste time on tuning
  spacing, moving around symbols, or shaping slurs. Impress friends and
  colleagues with sharp sheet music!
</p>
<p>
  Have fun!
