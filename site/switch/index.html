<p>

The inspiration for LilyPond came when two befriended musicians got
annoyed with the bland and boring look of computer print-out. Every
musician prefers reading beautiful music, so couldn't we programmers
solve that printing problem?
<p>
LilyPond just does that: it prints music in the best traditions of
classical engraving with minimum fuss. Don't waste time on tuning
spacing, moving around symbols, or shaping slurs. Impress friends and
colleagues with sharp sheet music!
</p>
<p>
  Have fun!
