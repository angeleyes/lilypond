<! te kort ... mag wat langer.>

Seven years ago, we set out to capture the rules of music engraving in
a program: a machine may be mechanic, but why should its products be?
Our quest and our answer are embodied in LilyPond. It prints music
beautifully, and we built it like we expect software to be: robust,
open and flexible.

<p>Have fun!
