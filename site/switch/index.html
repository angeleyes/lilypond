  Scores made with computers almost always look bland and uninspiring,
  but for what reason?  Machines may be mechanical, but why should their
  products be?  With that thought in mind we started programming seven
  years ago.  We have tried to capture the rules of good music engraving
  in a program, and that program is called <em>LilyPond</em>.  We built
  it like we expect software to be: robust, open and flexible.  The best
  is that you can create beautiful sheet music comfortably with
  LilyPond.

  Have fun!
