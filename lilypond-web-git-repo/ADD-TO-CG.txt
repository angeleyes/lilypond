Things you can do in this "web repo":


UPDATE TEXINFO SOURCE

1.  Run scripts/update-imported.sh.  THIS WILL KILL EVERYTHING IN
  imported/ !
  never, never edit anything inside imported/.  Edit
  those files in master instead!

2.  Check git-diff -- are all those changes good?

3.  If the changes are good, then commit them.


REBUILD EXAMPLES

1.  (optional, very infrequent) rebuild examples with "make examples"

2.  Check the output carefully -- do all the Examples still look good?

3.  If yes, commit them.  If no, investigate when the regression.


FIX SCRIPTS

1. scripts/ is the only sub-directory you should manually modify;
  it contains the "get changes from master" script, the "write
  version numbers + links + etc" script, and ...?
