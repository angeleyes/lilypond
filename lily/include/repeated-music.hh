/**
   Musical repeats.

   A repeat, when played has the form of BODY A BODY B BODY C.

   In this examples, the list {A B C} is put in ALTERNATIVES_P_.  BODY
   is put in REPEAT_BODY_P_.  Either the body or the alternative may
   be omitted.

   There are three modes of representing this  music:

   BODY A
        B
	C

   is called "folded". Mostly used for lyrics.

   
   BODY A B C

   is called volta.  This is common notation

   BODY A BODY B BODY C

   is called unfolded.  Useful for MIDI.

   If the number of repeats is smaller than the number of alternatives, then
   the excess alternatives are ignored for all timing purposes.

   If the number of repeats is bigger than the number of alternatives, then
   the first alternative is assumed to be repeated.
