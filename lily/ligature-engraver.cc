/*
 * This abstract class provides the general framework for ligatures of
 * any kind.  It cares for handling start/stop ligatures events and
 * collecting all noteheads inbetween, but delegates creation of a
 * ligature spanner for each start/stop pair and typesetting of the
 * ligature spanner to a concrete subclass.
 *
 * A concrete ligature engraver must subclass this class and provide
 * functions create_ligature_spanner () and typeset_ligature
 * (Spanner *, Array<Grob_info>).  Subclasses of this class basically
 * fall into two categories.
 *
 * The first category consists of engravers that engrave ligatures in
 * a way that really deserves the name ligature.  That is, they
 * produce a single connected graphical object of fixed width,
 * consisting of noteheads and other primitives.  Space may be
 * inserted only after each ligature, if necessary, but in no case
 * between the primitives of the ligature.  Accidentals have to be put
 * to the left of the ligature, and not to the left of individual
 * noteheads.  Class Coherent_ligature_engraver is the common
 * superclass for all of these engravers.
 *
 * The second category is for engravers that are relaxed in the sense
 * that they do not require to produce a single connected graphical
 * object.  For example, in contemporary editions, ligatures are often
 * marked, but otherwise use contemporary notation and spacing.  In
 * this category, there is currently only a single class,
 * Ligature_bracket_engraver, which marks each ligature with a
 * horizontal sqare bracket, but otherwise leaves the appearance
 * untouched.

/*
 * TODO: lyrics/melisma/syllables: there should be at most one
 * syllable of lyrics per ligature (i.e. for the lyrics context, a
 * ligature should count as a single note, regardless of how many
 * heads the ligature consists of).
 *
 * TODO: currently, you have to add/remove the proper
 * Ligature_engraver (Ligature_bracket_engraver,
 * Mensural_ligature_engraver) to the proper translator
 * (e.g. VoiceContext) to choose between various representations.
 * Since adding/removing an engraver to a translator is a global
 * action in the layout block, you cannot mix various representations
 * _within_ the same score.  Hence, for selecting a representation,
 * one would rather like to have a property that can be set e.g. for
 * several staves individually.  However, it seems that this approach
 * would require to have a single, complicated Ligature_engraver that
 * consists of all the code...  This needs further thoughts.
